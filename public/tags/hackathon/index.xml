      <description>Several weeks ago I was invited to be a technical leader at Scripted Hackathon. At the time, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t fully realized what I was getting into, or why I was even being invited - I had almost forgotten that I had met Emily and Rebecca from Scripted SF months ago at a pair programming meetup. I had jived with their organization&amp;rsquo;s objective - getting kids involved early in their lives in programming, through classes, tutoring, and events such as this hackathon.</description>

      <description>Well, to be fair, we won the Sensel challenge at the Developer Week Hackathon. Some other jabronis won the whole hackathon. But, still, something to put on the resume :)
We entered the Hackathon with a team of 4: Me, Riley, Rico, and Carolin. During the hackathon we picked up Swen, a fresh transplant from Europe here for a few weeks to experience the coding environment in San Francisco before starting a totally different career in London.</description>

      <description>I really should have posted this sooner, but I&amp;rsquo;m headed to the Developer Week Hackathon this weekend. After thoroughly enjoying last year&amp;rsquo;s API World Hackathon, I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to this, especially as I&amp;rsquo;m more prepared and know what to expect.
Typically these Hackathons have a list of partner-sponsored &amp;ldquo;challenges,&amp;rdquo; which involve using some company&amp;rsquo;s API or tool or whatever in your program. Prizes for winning a &amp;ldquo;challenge&amp;rdquo; are usually decided by the given company&amp;rsquo;s judges, with some sort of grand prize decided by the hackathon itself.</description>

      <description>This weekend I attended the API World Hackathon with Alex, Ben, and Matt. Other than Ben, this was all of our&amp;rsquo;s first Hackathon. We&amp;rsquo;re all Hack Reactor / Makersquare graduates as well, so it was a sort of return to a very familiar environment - fluorescent lights, harried group, and 11pm pull requests.
Got to work with a ton of cool APIs. There was some stuff out of my range of understanding - for example, NetappÂ was featuring some sort of distributed cloud VM service that I simply could not grock.</description>
