      <description>I went through a coding bootcamp, and coming out, one of my greatest weaknesses was a lack of breadth of general technical knowledge. I was anÂ active redditor and nerd in general so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t totally lost, but I noticed during meetups there were a lot of conversations I simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t participate in in a meaningful way because of my noobiness. When I went to a Hackathon, I watched people talk about technologies and solutions I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even aware existed - the classic &amp;ldquo;what I don&amp;rsquo;t know I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; problem.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how I used it, and I got a job out of Hack Reactor pretty quick, so trust me on this stuff.

      <description>I went to a coding bootcamp, and then I got hired. I want others to be able to do the same thing, so I will illustrate in as much detail as I am comfortable the things I did that I think led to me getting a job in ~1 month after graduating from a coding bootcamp. This will be one part of a many part series going over how I transformed from a Liberal Arts degree holder making 40k/year as a recruiter into a Software Engineer making ~120k/year.</description>
