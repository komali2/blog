<p>Well, to be fair, we won the <a href="http://accelerate.im/challenges/105">Sensel challenge</a> at the <a href="http://www.developerweek.com/hackathon/">Developer Week Hackathon</a>. Some other jabronis won the whole hackathon. But, still, something to put on the resume :)</p>

<p>We entered the Hackathon with a team of 4: Me, Riley, Rico, and Carolin. During the hackathon we picked up Swen, a fresh transplant from Europe here for a few weeks to experience the coding environment in San Francisco before starting a totally different career in London.</p>

<p>We started out just spitballing ideas and talking to the many sponsors about the tech they were bringing to the table. We had a sort of &ldquo;fingers in as many pies as possible&rdquo; strategy going in, figuring we wouldn&rsquo;t beat out top teams for the big prize so instead should target smaller prizes. So we thought we&rsquo;d combine <a href="http://accelerate.im/challenges/126">Aspera </a>with <a href="http://accelerate.im/challenges/99">Flowroute</a>Â to make some sort of weird photo-storage-tag-notification service. That idea flopped within about an hour of trying to figure out the Aspera API, which, at least in my case, has been a common theme with these Hackathon APIs.</p>

<p>We ended up making a very simple door-lock security solution using the Sensel dev boards. It uses a Python server to engage the Sensel board and fire off requests to a node API which connects to a database and web frontend.</p>

<p>The code is <a href="https://github.com/SleepyFishOrg/Uno">all here on github</a>, although it&rsquo;s pretty messy right now as we haven&rsquo;t touched it since the hackathon. Certain 10pm decisions include &ldquo;where is the data - request body? Params? Query string? Fuck it just do req.body.data || req.query || req.params.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All in all it was a fun time, and we got an awesome new friend out of it, as well as free burritos. Though they had packed the building to slightly terrifying levels (I&rsquo;m positive they would&rsquo;ve gotten a fat fire inspection fine), there was a fun sense of camaraderie and workmanship among all the members there.</p>
