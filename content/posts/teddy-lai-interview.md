I was lucky enough to be interviewed by friend and fellow [Crossroads](http://crossroads.tw/) member, [Teddy Lai](https://www.youtube.com/@teddylai886).

Teddy does street interviews of people in Taiwan and often comes across really interesting people.

In the interview, I got to talk about some of the things I love about Taiwan, and some things
that after 3 years I think I can fairly evaluate as worth improving. I also got to talk about
my engineering co-op, [508.dev](https://508.dev), which over the last two months since the interview has resulted
in membership exploding, and kicked off a new phase of the co-op. Thanks Teddy!
