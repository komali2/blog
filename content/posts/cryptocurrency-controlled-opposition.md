Capitalism is unsustainable, even from first principles: unending growth is an absurd concept considering the physical nature of our planet and universe.

Anti-capitalist attitudes are at an [all time high](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/20/eat-the-rich-why-millennials-and-generation-z-have-turned-their-backs-on-capitalism). This makes sense, as we reach late-stage capitalism. Wealth is more [concentrated than ever](https://www.cbpp.org/research/a-guide-to-statistics-on-historical-trends-in-income-inequality). The top 1% could lose 99.9999% percent of their net worth, and still be in the top 90% of wealthy people. An untenable situation that people are tired of.

It's time for a new system: socialism, anarchism, some combination thereof, regardless, it's time to evolve beyond capitalism, which has delivered us the technology to build a better world. Isn't that always the point?

However, capitalism is a sticky system. A hyper-adaptable organism. We saw it consume [ anti-capitalist Black Power rap ](https://www.hamptonthink.org/read/how-capitalism-underdeveloped-hip-hop-a-peoples-history-of-political-rap-part-1-of-2), turning it into a genre full mostly of glorified consumerism. We saw it deftly divert the working-class into culture war sentiment, somehow convincing large swaths of the working class to revel in their degredation and worship the billionaire class.

Recently, the liberating technology movement of FOSS, an inherently anti-capitalist, arguably inherently anarchist, is also being co-opted, with the instinct to liberate through technology being diverted to the ultimate capitalist instrument of cryptocurrency.

# The FOSS Pitch

FOSS, or Free and Open Source Software, has gone by a couple names over the years. The presumptive father of the movement, [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) calls it "Free Software" and has always been critical of the term [open source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html), believing that term has been co-opted by massive corporations to extract free labor from a global working class of engineers in countries like India that must have large Open Source projects on their portfolios to have any chance of finding work.

Regardless, the pitch ostensibly remains the same, as quoted from GNU:


> When we call software “free,” we mean that it respects the users' essential freedoms: the freedom to run it, to study and change it, and to redistribute copies with or without changes.

The FOSS movement has always been one about liberation.
