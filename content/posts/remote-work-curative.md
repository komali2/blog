# How Curative Scheduled 6.6 Million COVID Tests with a Fully Remote Team

Curative was founded in January of 2020, with the goal of improving outcomes for sepsis patients. A year later, and in the midst of global pandemic, it had delivered millions of COVID tests through its 13,000 testing sites across the USA, all managed through several applications related to patient booking and site management. These tools were built in a few very short months, and for the entirety of the pandemic, they have been improved.

Curative has no engineering office. Our engineers are in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, the United Kingdom, and Taiwan, all working from their homes. Our project managers are distributed, our designers are distributed, our executive team is distributed. Our testing sites are across America, yet all are using the same software, the same procedures, the same testing methods.

A system that distributed across disciplines, geography, and time zones, would be difficult to maintain in normal times, but it should have been nearly impossible for a brand-new company with all new hires in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic.

How did, and does, Curative manage to build and maintain such a system with a fully remote team?

# Why

Remote work is still looked on with skepticism by many, yet as Curative's founders faced down a pandemic, to work distributed only made sense. Testing sites were already very mobile, being either small prefab buildings in parking lots or simply vans.  As the engineering, design, and product teams built out, it was less "why go fully remote" and more "why should we have an office?"

Across the USA, many engineers were already working from home, including at FAANG companies, who often set the trends for the startup space.
