I've written plenty of times about how I think one of the coolest ways to see a country is on the back of a motorcycle. This is doubly true for Taiwan, [where my many videos can speak for themselves](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz49KNOFH8-lqwB-NBCHrUlYTyn6ij57Q** on the subect.

Renting a motorcycle in Taiwan is easier than you might expect. With just a little preparation, you could easily add a couple biking days to your next vacation here.

# Basic Info

It's worth knowing a couple basic things about motorcycling in Taiwan, it'll make understanding everything else a lot easier.

First, motorcycles in Taiwan are separated into four categories based on engine size, and each category has different licensing requirements. Each classification determines the color of license plate on the bike. From lowest to highest in terms of requirements (and engine size), the classifications are:

* Green Plate: certain electrics and less than 50cc engines
* White Plate: certain electrics, and 50cc to 250cc engines
* Yellow Plate: 250cc to 500cc engines
* Red Plate: 500cc and larger engines

These classifications apply to two wheeled vehicles only. Cars have their own plate color system.

Below, I'll get into more specifics about the restrictions and licensing requirements for each type, but to save you time if you're a motorcyclist: If you have an international driver's license with a motorcycle certification, you can ride all of the above :)

## Green Plate

Electrics and 50cc and under

Green plates are able to be rented on an international driver's license with no motorcycle certification. They can also be rented on a Taiwan car license with no scooter (white plate) certification. Your options for green plates include sketchy roadside rentals in places like Penghu or Hualien, as well as apps like iRent, Wemo, or GoShare.

Green plates have to ride in the scooter lane and make hook turns, can't ride on highways or flower roads, can't ride in the yellow "fast lane," can park in scooter parking spots, can lane split, and can use the scooter box at a stoplight.


## White Plate

50cc to 150cc

White plates can be rented on an international driver's license with a motorcycle certification, or a Taiwan scooter license (white plate). Sometimes, you can get away with an international driver's license with no motorcycle certification, but it's not dependable. Also sometimes, you can rent white plates as the same sketchy places in locations like Penghu or Hualien. There's some decent bikes in this category by the way, like CBRs and Ninjas. Most scooters you'll see are white plates.

White plates have to ride in the scooter lane and make hook turns, can't ride on highways or flower roads, can't ride in the yellow "fast lane," can park in scooter parking spots, can lane split, and can use the scooter box at a stoplight.

## Yellow Plate

250cc to 500cc

Yellow plates can be rented on an international driver's license with a motorcycle certificaiton, or a Taiwan Heavy Motorcycle License (yellow and red plate). You probably aren't going to get away with renting a yellow plate without the right license, no sketchy places or anything like that. Heavy motorcycles are really expensive in Taiwan, nobody's going to risk a bike like that uninsured. This is an excellent engine size category for Taiwan, especially for single-up riders. It's more than enough power.

Yellow plates can't ride in the scooter lane (legally, but often do anyway), can ride on certain highways and one or two flower roads in Taipei, can ride in the yellow "fast lane," can make left turns (but can't legally make hook turns), can't park in scooter parking spots (but often do anyway), can't legally lane split (but often do), and can't use the scooter box at a stoplight (but often do).

## Red Plate

500cc and up

Red plates can be rented on an international driver's license with a motorcycle certification, or a Taiwan Heavy Motorcycle License (yellow and red plate). You absolutely won't find anybody renting to you without the proper documentation, the cheapest red plates in rideable condition are $5,000 USD. The category is a little overpowered for Taiwan, unless you're a two-up rider.
