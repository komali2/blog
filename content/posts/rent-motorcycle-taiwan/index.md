I've written plenty of times about how I think one of the coolest ways to see a country is on the back of a motorcycle. This is doubly true for Taiwan, [where my many videos can speak for themselves](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz49KNOFH8-lqwB-NBCHrUlYTyn6ij57Q** on the subect.

Renting a motorcycle in Taiwan is easier than you might expect. With just a little preparation, you could easily add a couple biking days to your next vacation here.

# Basic Info

It's worth knowing a couple basic things about motorcycling in Taiwan, it'll make understanding everything else a lot easier.

First, motorcycles in Taiwan are separated into four categories based on engine size, and each category has different licensing requirements. Each classification determines the color of license plate on the bike. From lowest to highest in terms of requirements (and engine size), the classifications are:

* Green Plate: certain electrics and less than 50cc engines
* White Plate: certain electrics, and 50cc to 250cc engines
* Yellow Plate: 250cc to 500cc engines
* Red Plate: 500cc and larger engines

These classifications apply to two wheeled vehicles only. Cars have their own plate color system.

Below, I'll get into more specifics about the restrictions and licensing requirements for each type, but to save you time if you're a motorcyclist: If you have an international driver's license with a motorcycle certification, you can ride all of the above :)

## Green Plate

Electrics and 50cc and under

Green plates are able to be rented on an international driver's license with no motorcycle certification. They can also be rented on a Taiwan car license with no scooter (white plate) certification. Your options for green plates include sketchy roadside rentals in places like Penghu or Hualien, as well as apps like iRent, Wemo, or GoShare.

Green plates have to ride in the scooter lane and make hook turns, can't ride on highways or flower roads, can't ride in the yellow "fast lane," can park in scooter parking spots, can lane split, and can use the scooter box at a stoplight.


## White Plate

50cc to 150cc

White plates can be rented on an international driver's license with a motorcycle certification, or a Taiwan scooter license (white plate). Sometimes, you can get away with an international driver's license with no motorcycle certification, but it's not dependable. Also sometimes, you can rent white plates as the same sketchy places in locations like Penghu or Hualien. There's some decent bikes in this category by the way, like CBRs and Ninjas. Most scooters you'll see are white plates.

White plates have to ride in the scooter lane and make hook turns, can't ride on highways or flower roads, can't ride in the yellow "fast lane," can park in scooter parking spots, can lane split, and can use the scooter box at a stoplight.

## Yellow Plate

250cc to 500cc

Yellow plates can be rented on an international driver's license with a motorcycle certificaiton, or a Taiwan Heavy Motorcycle License (yellow and red plate). You probably aren't going to get away with renting a yellow plate without the right license, no sketchy places or anything like that. Heavy motorcycles are really expensive in Taiwan, nobody's going to risk a bike like that uninsured. This is an excellent engine size category for Taiwan, especially for single-up riders. It's more than enough power.

Yellow plates can't ride in the scooter lane (legally, but often do anyway), can ride on certain highways and one or two flower roads in Taipei, can ride in the yellow "fast lane," can make left turns (but can't legally make hook turns), can't park in scooter parking spots (but often do anyway), can't legally lane split (but often do), and can't use the scooter box at a stoplight (but often do).

## Red Plate

500cc and up

Red plates can be rented on an international driver's license with a motorcycle certification, or a Taiwan Heavy Motorcycle License (yellow and red plate). You absolutely won't find anybody renting to you without the proper documentation, the cheapest red plates in rideable condition are $5,000 USD. The category is a little overpowered for Taiwan, unless you're a two-up rider.


Red plates can't ride in the scooter lane (legally, but often do anyway), can ride on certain highways and one or two flower roads in Taipei, can ride in the yellow "fast lane,** can make left turns (but can't legally make hook turns), can't park in scooter parking spots (but often do anyway), can't legally lane split (but often do), and can't use the scooter box at a stoplight (but often do).

# Pre-Trip Requirements

Here's what you'll need to know about before arriving in Taiwan.


## International Driver's License

As noted above, regardless of the engine size of the motorcyle you want to rent, you need an international driver's license.

I can only speak with experience as an American here. Every country has their own version, and it's possible some countries' International Driver's Licenses aren't useable in Taiwan.

As for Americans, you can get your International Driver's License, or International Driving Permit (IDP) from [AAA](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html). (Fun fact: it's called AAA so it'd appear as the first entry in phonebooks. I recently learned that some of the newer generations don't know why so many businesses are AAA_something).

Sidenote: AAA is a private business, and it's kind of a glimpse behind the curtain here that they get to print a magic piece of paper that having in hand means you get to drive cars and motorcycles in other countries. All authority is bullshit, no gods no kings, etc etc.

It really is just a paper booklet with your picture in it, and its lent authority by a bunch of AAA stamps all over it. The stamping is great for you, cause Taiwan LOVES stamps. So, head into your local AAA, bring your driver's license with M classification on it (you'll obviously need to already have a motorcycle license...**, they can usually take your passport pictures there, and for something like 60 bucks you'll be out in less than an hour.

### IMPORTANT NOTE

The AAA IDP has several pages in various languages with locations to stamp your driving privileges: regular car, motorcycle, truck, etc. The AAA people vary in what they believe regarding stamping these pages: some think only stamping the English page is necessary, some believe only the English page and the page with the language corresponding to the country you're going to needs stamping. **They're wrong.**

**Every language page needs to be stamped in the car and motorcycle boxes to be valid.**

Countries like Taiwan and Japan don't just love the stamps, they *worship* the stamps, and if you don't have ALL your stamps in ALL the pages, you can't rent. This happened to me in Japan, and no amount of begging, pleading, showing them the English stamp, or live translating to Japanese using google translate, helped. They. Do. Not. Care.

They. Want. Their. Stamps.

The AAA people will tell you that you're wrong. They might simply refuse to stamp all the language pages. Be polite, but be firm. Agree with them. Say it's stupid. It is, after all, kinda stupid. But **get your stamps on every page**. Don't leave without those tamps. You won't be driving without all those stamps.

## Gear

The only gear you need by law in Taiwan is a helmet. Some shops will rent one to you for an extra fee, but I don't really trust those, so you might wanna bring your own. As a onebagger, doing so grates me, as I basically have to have a carryon if I have my helmet, but it's worth it to have my SENA and GoPro mount, as well as to not have to share sweat with and unknown number of people. In terms of other gear, I've written a bit about how to make this efficient in [some of my onebag posts](/tags/onebag).

## Experience

Experience is subjective, but you might wonder what level you should be at before you should consider riding in another country. Personally, I learned to ride in Vietnam after [riding across its entirety](posts/how-to-drive-motorcycle-across-vietnam/) a week after getting my motorcycle license, but I wouldn't really recommend that.

Taiwan is no Vietnam, but it is a little wilder than some places in the USA. The upside is that generally, the speeds are much lower, and the road conditions are much better. Also, while videos you watch may make the seas of scooters out to seem intimidating, so long as you just go with the flow, it isn't too hard to ride in the cities.

In any case, you know, ride to your comfort and all that, and if you think your experience is good enough to ride in a foreign country, when doing so, try to keep the speed reasonable.

# Tips

Taiwan has some specific weirdness about its road rules.

There's many things to be aware of if you're on a White or Green plate bike. First is the "hook turn." These vehicles can't make left turns at many lights, especially in the city. I thought it was a bit silly at first but honestly the roads are chaotic enough without scooters randomly darting to the left lane and then across all of oncoming to make a turn. It's better this way, trust me.

I'd recommend assuming your upcoming left turn is going to be a hook turn and being in the right lane in preparation. You can always just make a hook turn anyway, even if it wasn't necessary. But, to tell for certain if an intersection requires a hook turn, look for two things.

One is the blue hook turn sign. It looks like this:

 TODO add hook turn sign

Note that it isn't always there, and if you don't see it, that doesn't mean this isn't a hook turn intersection.

What *will* always be there is the hook turn box. At an intersection, there are sometimes two scooter boxes: one before the crosswalk, and one after. The one before is where you wait on a red, the one after is for people to your *left* that are looking to make a *left* turn, or in other words, parallel traffic from the left looking to turn onto your road and join your direction of travel. That's the box you'll go into when making a hook turn.

As for what to do with your indicators when performing a hook turn, nobody seems to know, and I didn't find any instruction for this when I was preparing for my licensing test in Taiwan. What my friends and I tend to do is flip on the right turn signal when approaching the intersection so people behind us expect our rightwards movement and our slowing down. Then as we get right up on the intersection, we flip the left indicator on, so as to not get cut off from someone to our left going faster than us and wanting to make a wider-radius right turn (which would result in a collission as you continue to go straight). Then we ride over to the box and flip off all our indicators. Obviously, during the whole maneauver, keep your head on a swivel, and take it at a reasonable speed.
