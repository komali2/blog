In early August, 2023, the Cross-Generational Bilingual Training Program in Taitung invited me to their Taitung In-Depth Tourism English Service Guided Tour, or, CGBTPiT's TIDTESGT. They have no website.

As far as I could determine, this program is from some kind of tourism-focused office of the Taidong government, with the objective of developing tourist activities for English speakers within Taidong county. Wait, but there's no "English" in the title of their Training Program, it just says "Bilingual!" Don't worry, in Taiwan, Bilingual can only ever mean "English and Mandarin" (a common critique of the [2030 Bilingual Nation Initiative](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01434632.2021.1909054?journalCode=rmmm20)).

Good motive, though they apparently had a bit of trouble getting recruits for the nearly all-expenses-paid trip. That might be because the only way I was able to hear about it was Jade sending me a [ Google Doc application for the trip ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1P-h2iYtBtCDBUuWQyzRrIvtcxiOyxU0gdB3Cf9vSykI/viewform?edit_requested=true**. That doc did have some nice videos from the previous couple trips, though:

Now that I re-read this form, I'm realizing I got the name wrong, above. it's actually the Taitung County Government International Development and Planning Department's trip, executed by CoCreate Planning & Design Consultancy, or TCGIDPDCCP$&DC for short. Who knows!

Point is, someone paid for my train tickets and housing to go to Taidong and stay there for two nights, including several incredible meals and really fun tours and activities. I had a great time and want to share some of the stuff we got up to beacuse it was a pretty cool way to check out Taidong.

## Day 0

### Train to Taidong

I grabbed a train from Taipei, at Songshan Station, to Taidong. If you get an express train, Usually labeled something like "T.C. Ltd. Exp (Coast Line)" or "T.C. Ltd. Exp (Mountain Line)", you can get to Taidong in just under 4.5 hours for about 750NTD one way. I booked on the TRA Android app which works shockingly well and takes USA credit cards.


I showed up on time, purposefully ignored the nice people with the cool flag that were obviously trying to get my attention so as to beeline to the bathroom, then came back out to meet up with my handlers, who drove us to the excellent [ Norden Ruder ](https://goo.gl/maps/LQ6EQTv75hqFVoTP6) hostel, my favorite place to stay in Taidong. We usually stay here for Crossroads trips as well.
