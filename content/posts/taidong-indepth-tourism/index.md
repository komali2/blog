In early August, 2023, the Cross-Generational Bilingual Training Program in Taitung invited me to their Taitung In-Depth Tourism English Service Guided Tour, or, CGBTPiT's TIDTESGT. They have no website.

As far as I could determine, this program is from some kind of tourism-focused office of the Taidong government, with the objective of developing tourist activities for English speakers within Taidong county. Wait, but there's no "English" in the title of their Training Program, it just says "Bilingual!" Don't worry, in Taiwan, Bilingual can only ever mean "English and Mandarin" (a common critique of the [2030 Bilingual Nation Initiative](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01434632.2021.1909054?journalCode=rmmm20)).

Good motive, though they apparently had a bit of trouble getting recruits for the nearly all-expenses-paid trip. That might be because the only way I was able to hear about it was Jade sending me a Google Doc application for the trip. That doc did have some nice videos from the previous couple trips, though:

* https://www.facebook.com/100063632803493/videos/189131489435966

Now that I re-read this form, I'm realizing I got the name wrong, above. it's actually the Taitung County Government International Development and Planning Department's trip, executed by CoCreate Planning & Design Consultancy, or TCGIDPDCCP&DC for short. Who knows!

Point is, someone paid for my train tickets and housing to go to Taidong and stay there for two nights, including several incredible meals and really fun tours and activities. I had a great time and want to share some of the stuff we got up to beacuse it was a pretty cool way to check out Taidong.

## Day 0

### Train to Taidong

I grabbed a train from Taipei, at Songshan Station, to Taidong. If you get an express train, usually labeled something like "T.C. Ltd. Exp (Coast Line)" or "T.C. Ltd. Exp (Mountain Line)", you can get to Taidong in just under 4.5 hours for about 750NTD one way. I booked on the TRA Android app which works shockingly well and takes USA credit cards.

### Stay at Norden Ruder hostel

{{< figure src="peoplesteven.jpg" alt="Steven holding a banner" caption="Steven was our main dude" >}}

I showed up on time, purposefully ignored the nice people with the cool flag that were obviously trying to get my attention so as to beeline to the bathroom, then came back out to meet up with my handlers, who drove us to the excellent [ Norden Ruder ](https://goo.gl/maps/LQ6EQTv75hqFVoTP6) hostel, my favorite place to stay in Taidong. We usually stay here for Crossroads trips as well.

{{< figure src="hostel1.jpg" alt="Fish tank in the hostel" caption="They have really cool intererior design" >}}
{{< figure src="hostel2.jpg" alt="View of the hostel from the bottom floor" caption="The hostel is built around this really nice lobby on the bottom floor that gets lots of natural light" >}}
{{< figure src="hostel3.jpg" alt="Map of taidong on hostel wall" caption="Surprisingly useful map of Taidong!" >}}

### Eat a Hella Good Dinner

Steven recommended a couple really good looking restaurants, but only one of his suggestions was actually open, a place that focuses on red quinoia called [ "七里坡紅藜養生料理" ](https://goo.gl/maps/MWGWaMtmg3jhbEAa9). It was really good! The three of us relaxed and got to know eachother, since Bream was busy.

{{< figure src="firstfood1.jpg" alt="Some kind of fruit drink" caption="Really refreshing fruity almost smoothie-like drink" >}}
{{< figure src="firstfood2.jpg" alt="Pudding" caption="Really good black sugar pudding with perhaps quinoia on top" >}}
{{< figure src="firstfood3.jpg" alt="Cold tofu and noodle salad" caption="Cold tofu noodle salad" >}}
{{< figure src="firstfood4.jpg" alt="Fish set" caption="I got a fish set, it was really fresh!" >}}

## Day 1

{{< figure src="hostelcoffee.jpg" alt="Coffee" caption="First, coffee at Norden Ruder! They have really good pour overs available from local Taiwan growers" >}}
{{< figure src="peopleliana.jpg" alt="Liana making coffee" caption="Liana making coffee" >}}

### Taromak Rukai Community Tour

Our first big tour was at [ Taromak Rukai ](https://goo.gl/maps/2M37DaXWJ58rZsZv6) tribe. In Mandarin that's 達魯瑪克部落.

{{< figure src="tribescooterhost.jpg" alt="Our tour guide arriving on a scooter" caption="Our tour guide showed up in full kit on a scooter" >}}

We hung out for a bit with our tour guide in his really cool outfit waiting for the student that was apparently supposed to translate for us, then kicked off an "entering ritual," or 入村儀式.

{{< figure src="tribe1.jpg" alt="The translator and the tour guide" caption="They found some student to function as translator. She was pretty good!" >}}

Bream and I were volunteered for the entering ritual. It involved standing before the big statue at the entrance to the tribe, shouting some things, and chucking a small bamboo cup of liquor into the air after taking a small sip. It sounded like we were giving thanks and offerings to ancestors and various animist spirits, such as the mountains, air, forest, etc. Fresh start to the day!


{{< figure src="tribedrink.jpg" alt="Bream and I doing the entering ritual" caption="Bream and I listening attentively to the man with the half meter machete" >}}
{{< figure src="tribedrink2.jpg" alt="The bamboo cup used to present alcohol" caption="The little bamboo cup, equivalent to a double shot I'd say" >}}
{{< figure src="tribeentrance.jpg" alt="The statue at the entrance to the tribe" caption="The statue at the entrance to the tribe, where we performed the entering ritual" >}}

{{< figure src="tribecat.jpg" alt="Cat" caption="This cat licked its balls throughout the presentation." >}}

{{< figure src="tribepointentrance.jpg" alt="The group posing with a banner near the tribe entrance" caption="The guide was insistent that we all take a picture of us all pointing at the sky" >}}

From here we wandered over to a fire memorial, 火災紀念亭, commemorating a tragedy that had occured some 60 or so years ago, where a large portion of the village burned down during lunar new year. The guide cracked a joke about a new years BBQ that the student refused to translate, lol.

{{< figure src="tribeenvironment.jpg" alt="The mountains around the tribe" caption="Though hot, the environment around the tribe was gorgeous, with the thickly jungled mountains in the distance" >}}

Next was a history lesson and notes on the myths and customs of the tribe, in mandarin 部落簡史、文化與神話故事. They had a couple panels depicting mythological scenes, as well as a large pole with a sculpture on top that included many symbols important to the tribe.

{{< figure src="tribehistory.jpg" alt="The tour guide teaching us about myths of the tribe" caption="" >}}

The myth he spent the most time on involved a small and large species of deer, and their involvement in acquiring fire for humans, who in the mythos could communicate with animals directly. There was a swapping of antlers involved in the story, which the small species of deer is still upset with to this day, which is why its barking cry sounds like "fuck! fuck!" I think it'd be interesting to follow up more on these myths because the acquisition of fire myth sounded a lot like a promethean myth.

{{< figure src="tribeart2.jpg" alt="Depiction of making traditional food" caption="This panel showed the making of a traditional food from millet. I just like how stacked the dudes were. Also included, in the top left, is the swing for which the tribe is famous; more on that later." >}}

{{< figure src="tribeart.jpg" alt="The sculpture on top of the pole" caption="Many symbols on the sculpture. From the top are two 'blade feathers' from an eagle, the largest wing feather, which only a chief is allowed to wear. The lilies are worn by virgin women, and if the village clothesperson thinks you aren't a virgin, they can rip off the lily and publicly humiliate you. The pot (center portion) symbolizes a woman's womb, but also each family has a family pot in the house. If family members leave, they crack off a piece of the pot, so if they return even decades later, they can prove their membership in the family by matching their fragment of the pot to the one in the home. The crossed machetes are just machetes and I think they're included because people just think they're kinda cool.">}}

{{< figure src="tribeaesthetic.jpg" alt="Closeup of mural" caption="I liked the murals they had all over the place.">}}

The tour guide talked on and off about how the tribe faired during Japanese occupation, and mentioned specifically really classic fascist techniques employed, such as choosing specific members of the tribe to police the camp they'd all been moved to, rather than use Japanese soldiers to do so. He lamented that the Japanese also forced them to stop their custom of beheading intruders, and that the Japanese forced them to make toilets.

{{< figure src="tribebutterfly.jpg" alt="Butterflies" caption="There were hundreds of butterflies around." >}}
{{< figure src="tribepoint2.jpg" alt="All of us posing in front of the sculpture" caption="We must stand and point again before moving on." >}}

Next we walk into the village proper to check out the chieftain's house, 頭目家與祖靈屋. On the way we pass a Christian funeral for a really old member of the tribe, apparently an elder of some form. Christian iconography is a constant theme in Taidong tribes, with various missionaries showing up frequently over the last century or so, usually with gifts and aid. The tribes, typically removed from the greater benefits of whoever is imperialising them at the time, welcome the missionaries and their gifts with open arms, and then the missionaries get to work convertin'. It's unclear just how serious tribal members are about Christianity, or how animist the religion has become in the meantime. They certainly maintain a large portion of their customs and beliefs, particularly around death and ancestor worship.

{{< figure src="tribechristian1.jpg" alt="The church at which the funeral was being held" caption="Top of the church where the funeral was being held." >}}
{{< figure src="tribechristian2.jpg" alt="Virgin mary statue in a community center" caption="Virgin mary statue in a community center." >}}

We walked up to the chieftian's house, which was near another building that I believe traditionally was where the millet was stored. We apparently weren't supposed to point at the building or really even look at it too much. We were given some kind of explanation about how the food there was reserved for the sick, but I wasn't clear on that.

{{< figure src="tribechieftanhouse.JPG" alt="The doorway of the chieftan's house" caption="The chieftan gets to have iconography around his door that nobody else does, such as the blade feathers on a headband. Note as well the traditional pot." >}}

{{< figure src="tribeheadguy.jpg" alt="Statue of a man" caption="The unfortunately now banned practice of beheading is memorialized." >}}
{{< figure src="tribesuskid.jpg" alt="A kid on a toy car" caption="We got to see what the locals were up to." >}}
{{< figure src="tribescooterkid.jpg" alt="A man and kid on a scooter" caption="" >}}
{{< figure src="tribetabledog.jpg" alt="Dog on a table" caption="It was hot, the dog was cooling off." >}}
{{< figure src="tribeoldscooterguy.jpg" alt="Man on a scooter" caption="People in the south don't wear helmets, I've no idea why." >}}

We hop in our bus to go up the mountain a bit. On the way, we pass the largest of the swings that make the tribe famous. The swings are used during various festivals.

{{< figure src="tribebigsqing.jpg" alt="Big swing in a field" caption="This swing is the largest in the country, and was built entirely by hand." >}}

Our first stop at the top of the mountain is a smaller version of the big swing. As the only unmarried woman in our group, Liana is put on the swing. The tour guide instructs Bream to take her off the swing "without letting her touch the ground," which leads to some confusion, but eventually he figures it out.


{{< figure src="tribeswingride.jpg" alt="Liana riding the small swing" caption="Only unmarried women are allowed to ride the swing. Bummer." >}}
{{< figure src="tribeswingdone.jpg" alt="Bream carrying Liana" caption="Newlywed husbands carry their wives off the swing, and then don't set them down for as long as they can, as a ritual show of strength." >}}

From there we were toured around the jungle a bit, with the tour guide occassionally pointing out and picking plants that were edible, and letting us taste them. This was my favorite part of the day.

{{< figure src="tribeplantseat1.jpg" alt="The tour guide holding an edible plant" caption="Some of the plants were sweet, others sour." >}}
{{< figure src="tribeplantseat2.jpg" alt="The tour guide standing next to another edible plant" caption="Many plants are used as seasonings." >}}
{{< figure src="tribeplantseat3.jpg" alt="A closeup shot of one of the plants" caption="I'm not sure I'll be able to remember which plants are which! This one was sweet." >}}
{{< figure src="tribeplantseat4.jpg" alt="A coffee tree in the jungle." caption="They also had coffee trees growing randomly in the jungle!" >}}
{{< figure src="tribeplantseat5.jpg" alt="Unidentified plant" caption="No idea what this is. Looks cool though!" >}}

The tour guide also pointed out a stinging nettle plant, and told a story about how adults aren't allowed to hurt children that aren't their own, but they can smack them with stinging nettle, and he believed this to be an effective form of corporeal punishment. Hm.

{{< figure src="tribalselfie.jpg" alt="The tour guide taking a selfie with all of us" caption="Inevitable jungle selfie." >}}

After this the tour guide stuffed us in a hollow tree and told us the tribe likes hollow trees because they smack them with sticks to communicate across long distances, and also because there's often beehives inside where they can get honey. Our tree also had a beehive, which made me think about murder hornets, so I didn't enjoy being in the hollow tree. Also, he makes us listen to the tree bark, and is surprised we hear nothing. He says the ability to hear the tree is based on wisdom, so I guess we aren't wise. He says that hunters have to have very sensitive hearing in the forest.

{{< figure src="tribetree.jpg" alt="All of us in a tree" caption="" >}}

He hikes us up past a bunch of old Japanese bomb shelters, passes out a bunch of headlamps, and takes us into an old cave full of bats. He wants us to be careful to not shine lights at the bats or be too loud and disturb them, but as soon as we enter the bats start flying around, so, they were disturbed despite our efforts.

{{< figure src="tribebat.jpg" alt="A bat in the cave" caption="It was very hard to take a picture of the bat in the dark cave." >}}
{{< figure src="tribecave.jpg" alt="Andrea silhouetted in the cave." caption="Classic Taiwan thing, wait around for 15 minutes while everyone takes some preplanned photo thing. 'Cave silhouette' is now in my 'Stock Taiwan Photos' repertoire, alongside 'Jumping on the Beach' and 'Sticking My Ass Out on a Stand Up Paddleboard.'" >}}

{{< figure src="tribepoint3.jpg" alt="All of us pointing in the jungle" caption="Have to take the pointing picture before we can move on." >}}

After the cave, we hiked over to a hut, where food was being set up, and a couple bow had been set out with some arrows for us to fiddle with. To access the hut, we had to step over some reeds on the ground, as well as an incense pot. This was supposed to dispell bad spirits or something.


{{< figure src="tribesteppy.jpg" alt="Bream and others stepping over the reeds on the ground." caption="Stepping over the reeds to dispel the spirits." >}}
{{< figure src="tribebow.jpg" alt="Liana shooting a bow and arrow, observed by the tour guide." caption="Liana was scary good with the bow." >}}
{{< figure src="tribebow2.jpg" alt="Bream shooting the bow." caption="Bream shot the bow alright, boy did he ever shoot that bow." >}}

After we were done messin around, we're brought to a pile of dirt and rocks. This was a traditional way of cooking called, I believe, "Ichibi." The method involves having the kids dig a huge pit and chucking a bunch of vegetables and whatever other food into it. They cover this with stones, set a fire on the stones, and then cover the whole thing in mud and let it cook. Apparently it doesn't cook very well but they eat it anyway. It's supposed to be a good activity to do when the parents are out hunting or whatever, and the grandparents want to keep the kids busy. Thus, the tour guide seemed to feel quite nostalgic about it. He described his culture as a scarcity culture and said that being able to eat so much food at once was a delight.

{{< figure src="tribefoodcovered.jpg" alt="The food covered in rocks and dirt" caption="The tour guide said that typically the food is just chucked straight up into a bit and covered with rocks and dirt, but they wrapped it all in tinfoil and covered it with a pot for our sake." >}}

We dig out the Ichibi and bring it over to a table where a veritable feast had been lain out. It's all super good food. I really like the blood sausage. Some of the food is made with herbs we saw in the forest. I like that. We eat and talk a while. Some tea is served, which we can optionally mix with a millet wine they make locally. I thought it was surprisingly refreshing.

{{< figure src="tribefoodbeans.jpg" alt="Beans" caption="" >}}

{{< figure src="tribefoodsoup.jpg" alt="Soup" caption="" >}}
{{< figure src="tribefoodbowl.jpg" alt="My bowl of food" caption="Really hearty, seemingly quite healthy, lunch!" >}}

After lunch we had a feedback session, which was part of why the government was paying for us to be there: we were to let the tour guide know what we thought, and any suggestions we have. Personally I didn't really have any notes, I had a great time, and mentioned I'd have paid a lot to just walk around the forest with the dude and learn about all the plants and what I can eat.

{{< figure src="tribebell.jpg" alt="Liana walking with the bell on her waist" caption="Liana shaking her bell." >}}

We finish off with some kind of traditional activity where a bell is strapped to our waist and we walk and try to regularly ring the bell with our hip movement. Liana and I both do it, and she has more swagger than me so she wins handily. It's explained to us that bells make for a good way to communicate across great distances.

{{< figure src="tribebye.jpg" alt="Final picture of us all pointing at the sky." caption="Final pointing at the sky picture!" >}}

### Sunrise Driftwood Workshop and Paiwan Tribal Community Tour

After that excellent and exhausting tour, we pile back onto the bus and, after a quick 7-11 stop (refill water bottles!!), we all pass out for the hour drive to the next tribe we were to visit.

We stop at a teahouse right above [ Duoliang Railway Station ](https://goo.gl/maps/oEBfa5MV9DqLshr7A), which I believe is the more famous thing in the area. The station is defunct now, but affords good photos of trains with the ocean in the background, if you're into that kind of thing, which judging by the google maps page for the thing, many thousands of people are.


{{< figure src="woodtrain1.jpg" alt="Bream looking at an approaching train" caption="" >}}
{{< figure src="woodtrain2.jpg" alt="A train with the ocean in the background" caption="The ocean was gorgeous that day!" >}}
{{< figure src="wooddrinks.jpg" alt="A tray of drinks" caption="The fruit tea was very refreshing on this extremely hot day." >}}

The tea shop was combined with the [local cultural center](https://goo.gl/maps/qYmTNozmzMpSYZ6C9), which included a woodworking shop. The woodworking cultural center thing was set up after a major typhoon caused a great deal of destruction in the village, upon which many descendants of villagers came back from Taipei and elsewhere to help rebuild. They didn't really have any carpentry experience, so older folks taught them, and then they applied these skills to making other cool things, like art. Now the woodworking shop is used to create art, toys, and puzzles from local driftwood and wood.

{{< figure src="woodman.jpg" alt="A man working with some wood" caption="Unfortunately we didn't get to do any woodworking." >}}
{{< figure src="woodwooddesign.jpg" alt="Some carved driftwood" caption="The local developed their style to show off more of the intricacies of the local driftwood." >}}
{{< figure src="woodwoodpuzzle.jpg" alt="A wood puzzle" caption="We spent a fair bit of time playing with the wooden blocks." >}}

This tour was a bit less structured than the previous one, with a younger local finding us after we'd been chilling out for a bit, and reading a script off a piece of paper in somewhat challenged English. We quickly switched to preferring her to just speak Mandarin while Liana and Steven helped translate. No local student provided for translation here, for some reason, not that I minded.

We were given rides (why not just a quick hike? I'm not sure) higher up the mountain into the tribal area proper, where we were brought to a little supermarket all the people we met really liked to talk about. It was run by the third generation of a family of Han Chinese that had come to the village decades ago. They're reknown for being kind and letting children and poor people just take food. Later we learn they keep fastidious records and people would often find their grandparents had large debts at the store after they died. A lot of the food in the supermarket was super oldschool, lots of various canned good that Stephen and the other Taiwanese kept saying they hadn't seen in ages. That made me think about how boomers seemed to be eating a lot of funky canned food, which I thought was just a USA thing, but apparently not. We all bought little ice creams and headed to the second stop: a cool overhang that the village chief built cause he thought it would be a cool place to hang out in.

{{< figure src="woodhangout.jpg" alt="Hanging out in the overhang thing." caption="Nice view!" >}}
{{< figure src="woodoldlady.jpg" alt="An old lady picking plants." caption="An old lady was picking random plants below us." >}}
{{< figure src="woodtourguide.jpg" alt="Our tourgide for Paiwan tribe." caption="Our tour guide." >}}
{{< figure src="woodmotorcycleguy.jpg" alt="A man on a motorcycle, outside the little supermarket." caption="Just some guy I liked the vibe of, coming to pick something up from the supermarket." >}}

We piled back into the cars for another short ride (why not just hike???) to a cafe up on the hill. This was really cool, a gorgeous natural wood cafe with all outside seating, facing out over the ocean. Surrounded by native plants and little nick-nacks. All local to Taiwan tea, coffee, and snacks. We hung out at the cafe for a few hours without any kind of intinerary, so we basically interrogated the tour guide on information about the village, the tribal lifestyle, why she decided to move back to the town from Taipei, and etc.

{{< figure src="wooddragonfruit.jpg" alt="A dragonfruit plant" caption="There was wild dragonfruit growing near the cafe." >}}
{{< figure src="woodfruit.jpg" alt="Fruit growing on a tree" caption="And other fruit!" >}}

This tribe has two elders because one was essentially robbed of a bunch of shells by another village, so an elder from another tribe that married in took over the role. Apparently the shells were very valuable.

{{< figure src="woodsweetpotato.jpg" alt="Sweet potato slices" caption="Local sweet potato, baked. Addicting." >}}
{{< figure src="woodwaffle.jpg" alt="A waffle" caption="The waffle looked really fun but was just ok." >}}

Apparently the cafe owner worked with the mayor to build the cafe without needing to buy land or pay rent, just because it improves the environment. Traditionally the tribe does communal ownership of land, but the Qing / ROC governments both required SOMEONE to own the land, which caused chaos. They also had stories about the initial arrival of Qing dynasty people, who would just farm wherever, then claim the land as their own. The tribe would do the same in return to make land claims, until one Qing governor just locked everything in (they describe him as "great").


{{< figure src="woodfruitdrink.jpg" alt="A fruit tea drink" caption="All the drinks at the cafe were really good." >}}
{{< figure src="woodcoffee.jpg" alt="Cold brewed coffee" caption="Local cold brewed coffee, very strong." >}}

The cafe owner's dream for the village is for more young people to come back. She's not sure what they could do, or how the village could accomomdate a huge influx of people if it involved buildling more housing. She says it's difficult to think of ways to make money.

{{< figure src="woodcat.jpg" alt="A cat" caption="They had cafe kittens." >}}

After a long hangout, we head back down to the woodshop, and then to the abandoned train station. There's a little food market down there that we ignore. We take some pics, then load onto the bus and head back to Taidong proper.

{{< figure src="woodchristian.jpg" alt="A cross emblazoned with traditional tribal symbols" caption="Lots of Christianity at this tribe too. We were told the village is almost entirely Christian, with the noticeable exception of the supermarket owner and the cafe owner." >}}
{{< figure src="woodbye.jpg" alt="All of us posing for a goodbye picture" caption="Goodbye!" >}}

### Eat Another Hella Good Dinner

Back in Taidong, we go to an apparently famous chicken place, [ "Haijing Chicken Restaurant" ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KPu6p6uuyMAujdVk8). Food was good.

{{< figure src="finalmeal1.jpg" alt="Cooked squid" caption="Squid" >}}
{{< figure src="finalmeal2.jpg" alt="Luroufan" caption="Luroufan!!" >}}
{{< figure src="finalmeal3.jpg" alt="Something" caption="I have no idea, but yummy!" >}}
{{< figure src="finalmeal4.jpg" alt="chicken" caption="Chicken!" >}}

After that, we went to our hotel for the night, ["SUP Daily"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2iem8xeeHZvfxWwh7). They had lots of animals.

{{< figure src="suphostelcat.jpg" alt="Cat" caption="" >}}
{{< figure src="suphostelfrog.jpg" alt="Frog" caption="" >}}

We had to get up at like, 5am the next day for stand up paddleboarding, so we went to bed pretty early.


## Day 2

### Stand Up Paddleboarding at Asscrack of Dawn

At some ungodly hour we woke up and piled onto the bus.

{{< figure src="supbus.JPG" alt="The bus in the morning" caption="Hi, bus." >}}

We drove over to a sort of lake not too far away. It was very pretty in the morning.

{{< figure src="supwaves.JPG" alt="Ocean in the distance." caption="Massive waves in the distance." >}}
{{< figure src="supboard.JPG" alt="The stand up paddleboards in the morning." caption="Very calm, much better than trying this in the ocean, I think." >}}

We originally were going to do stand up paddleboarding in the ocean, but they were concerned about the conditions of the water so close to a typhoon, so we instead went to a beautiful, placid lake. Best part is that we started at a much more reasonable time. I think we were going to try to do the ocean one at like, 4am or something ridiculous.

{{< figure src="supboss.jpg" alt="All of us getting some stand up paddleboard coaching" caption="We got some coaching from a teacher before we started." >}}

After a brief lesson, we were strapped into some lifejackets and pushed out into the lake on our boards. We were all able to stand on our boards without too much trouble after only a few minutes of practice, after which we zipped all around the lake, stopping occassionally for our guide to teach us some new techniques or game. There was a couple Taiwanese people not a part of our tour. They were more interested in taking photos and hanging around, while the rest of us got roudy and spent our time shoving eachother off our boards, racing, and doing yoga.

{{< figure src="suppose.jpg" alt="Liana doing a yoga pose on a stand up paddleboard" caption="Yoga skills." >}}

After maybe an hour and a half or so, we all paddle back to shore, load up onto the bus, and head back to the hotel for naps.

### Eat Hella Good Lunch

After packing up, we load onto the bus and drive WAY out to [Chenggong Township](https://maps.app.goo.gl/821CbF65SNc8Ur4k7), a town about an hour from Taidong that's famous for its harbor, where spearfisherman dock and sell marlin. Our first destination is a reknown and award-winning slow food restaurant, [旗遇海味](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EBJ7ZJwC9tzncEjVA). We arrive a little earlier than expected, and nobody's hungry yet because of the breakfast we all ate (I didn't eat breakfast and was starving lol but oh well), so we swapped our day arounda little bit and explored the fish auction area and looked at the spear fishing boats.

{{< figure src="chengboats.JPG" alt="Boats in Chenggong harbor" caption="The boats all had really cool designs and surprisingly clean paintjobs. The sloping ramp in the bottom left of the image is where a spear fisherman stands / squats, looking out for a marlin to spear. Apparently accidents are somewhat rare, but when they do happen they can be somewhat horrifying because the fisherman is partially strapped in. Though, according to the restaurant owner, only one person has died during his lifetime." >}}
