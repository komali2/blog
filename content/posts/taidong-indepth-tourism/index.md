In early August, 2023, the Cross-Generational Bilingual Training Program in Taitung invited me to their Taitung In-Depth Tourism English Service Guided Tour, or, CGBTPiT's TIDTESGT. They have no website.

As far as I could determine, this program is from some kind of tourism-focused office of the Taidong government, with the objective of developing tourist activities for English speakers within Taidong county. Wait, but there's no "English" in the title of their Training Program, it just says "Bilingual!" Don't worry, in Taiwan, Bilingual can only ever mean "English and Mandarin" (a common critique of the [2030 Bilingual Nation Initiative](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01434632.2021.1909054?journalCode=rmmm20)).

Good motive, though they apparently had a bit of trouble getting recruits for the nearly all-expenses-paid trip. That might be because the only way I was able to hear about it was Jade sending me a Google Doc application for the trip. That doc did have some nice videos from the previous couple trips, though:

Now that I re-read this form, I'm realizing I got the name wrong, above. it's actually the Taitung County Government International Development and Planning Department's trip, executed by CoCreate Planning & Design Consultancy, or TCGIDPDCCP&DC for short. Who knows!

Point is, someone paid for my train tickets and housing to go to Taidong and stay there for two nights, including several incredible meals and really fun tours and activities. I had a great time and want to share some of the stuff we got up to beacuse it was a pretty cool way to check out Taidong.

## Day 0

### Train to Taidong

I grabbed a train from Taipei, at Songshan Station, to Taidong. If you get an express train, usually labeled something like "T.C. Ltd. Exp (Coast Line)" or "T.C. Ltd. Exp (Mountain Line)", you can get to Taidong in just under 4.5 hours for about 750NTD one way. I booked on the TRA Android app which works shockingly well and takes USA credit cards.

### Stay at Norden Ruder hostel

{{< figure src="peoplesteven.jpg" alt="Steven holding a banner" caption="Steven was our main dude" >}}

I showed up on time, purposefully ignored the nice people with the cool flag that were obviously trying to get my attention so as to beeline to the bathroom, then came back out to meet up with my handlers, who drove us to the excellent [ Norden Ruder ](https://goo.gl/maps/LQ6EQTv75hqFVoTP6) hostel, my favorite place to stay in Taidong. We usually stay here for Crossroads trips as well.

### Eat a Hella Good Dinner

Steven recommended a couple really good looking restaurants, but only one of his suggestions was actually open, a place that focuses on red quinoia called [ "七里坡紅藜養生料理" ](https://goo.gl/maps/MWGWaMtmg3jhbEAa9). It was really good! The three of us relaxed and got to know eachother, since Bream was busy.

### Taromak Rukai Community Tour

Our first big tour was at [ Taromak Rukai ](https://goo.gl/maps/2M37DaXWJ58rZsZv6) tribe. In Mandarin that's 達魯瑪克部落.

{{< figure src="tribescooterhost.jpg" alt="Our tour guide arriving on a scooter" caption="Our tour guide showed up in full kit on a scooter" >}}

We hung out for a bit with our tour guide in his really cool outfit waiting for the student that was apparently supposed to translate for us, then kicked off an "entering ritual," or 入村儀式.

{{< figure src="tribe1.jpg" alt="The translator and the tour guide" caption="They found some student to function as translator. She was pretty good!" >}}

Bream and I were volunteered for the entering ritual. It involved standing before the big statue at the entrance to the tribe, shouting some things, and chucking a small bamboo cup of liquor into the air after taking a small sip. It sounded like we were giving thanks and offerings to ancestors and various animist spirits, such as the mountains, air, forest, etc. Fresh start to the day!

{{< figure src="tribepointentrance.jpg" alt="The group posing with a banner near the tribe entrance" caption="The guide was insistent that we all take a picture of us all pointing at the sky" >}}

From here we wandered over to a fire memorial, 火災紀念亭, commemorating a tragedy that had occured some 60 or so years ago, where a large portion of the village burned down during lunar new year. The guide cracked a joke about a new years BBQ that the student refused to translate, lol.

{{< figure src="tribeenvironment.jpg" alt="The mountains around the tribe" caption="Though hot, the environment around the tribe was gorgeous, with the thickly jungled mountains in the distance" >}}

Next was a history lesson and notes on the myths and customs of the tribe, in mandarin 部落簡史、文化與神話故事. They had a couple panels depicting mythological scenes, as well as a large pole with a sculpture on top that included many symbols important to the tribe.

{{< figure src="tribehistory.jpg" alt="The tour guide teaching us about myths of the tribe" caption="" >}}

The myth he spent the most time on involved a small and large species of deer, and their involvement in acquiring fire for humans, who in the mythos could communicate with animals directly. There was a swapping of antlers involved in the story, which the small species of deer is still upset with to this day, which is why its barking cry sounds like "fuck! fuck!" I think it'd be interesting to follow up more on these myths because the acquisition of fire myth sounded a lot like a promethean myth.

{{< figure src="tribeart2.jpg" alt="Depiction of making traditional food" caption="This panel showed the making of a traditional food from millet. I just like how stacked the dudes were. Also included, in the top left, is the swing for which the tribe is famous; more on that later." >}}

{{< figure src="tribeart.jpg" alt="The sculpture on top of the pole" caption="Many symbols on the sculpture. From the top are two 'blade feathers' from an eagle, the largest wing feather, which only a chief is allowed to wear. The lilies are worn by virgin women, and if the village clothesperson thinks you aren't a virgin, they can rip off the lily and publicly humiliate you. The pot (center portion) symbolizes a woman's womb, but also each family has a family pot in the house. If family members leave, they crack off a piece of the pot, so if they return even decades later, they can prove their membership in the family by matching their fragment of the pot to the one in the home. The crossed machetes are just machetes and I think they're included because people just think they're kinda cool.">}}

{{< figure src="tribeaesthetic.jpg" alt="Closeup of mural" caption="I liked the murals they had all over the place.">}}

The tour guide talked on and off about how the tribe faired during Japanese occupation, and mentioned specifically really classic fascist techniques employed, such as choosing specific members of the tribe to police the camp they'd all been moved to, rather than use Japanese soldiers to do so. He lamented that the Japanese also forced them to stop their custom of beheading intruders, and that the Japanese forced them to make toilets.

{{< figure src="tribebutterfly.jpg" alt="Butterflies" caption="There were hundreds of butterflies around." >}}
{{< figure src="tribepoint2.jpg" alt="All of us posing in front of the sculpture" caption="We must stand and point again before moving on." >}}

Next we walk into the village proper to check out the chieftain's house, 頭目家與祖靈屋. On the way we pass a Christian funeral for a really old member of the tribe, apparently an elder of some form. Christian iconography is a constant theme in Taidong tribes, with various missionaries showing up frequently over the last century or so, usually with gifts and aid. The tribes, typically removed from the greater benefits of whoever is imperialising them at the time, welcome the missionaries and their gifts with open arms, and then the missionaries get to work convertin'. It's unclear just how serious tribal members are about Christianity, or how animist the religion has become in the meantime. They certainly maintain a large portion of their customs and beliefs, particularly around death and ancestor worship.

We walked up to the chieftian's house, which was near another building that I believe traditionally was where the millet was stored. We apparently weren't supposed to point at the building or really even look at it too much. We were given some kind of explanation about how the food there was reserved for the sick, but I wasn't clear on that.

{{< figure src="tribechieftanhouse.JPG" alt="The doorway of the chieftan's house" caption="The chieftan gets to have iconography around his door that nobody else does, such as the blade feathers on a headband. Note as well the traditional pot." >}}

{{< figure src="tribeoldscooterguy.jpg" alt="Man on a scooter" caption="People in the south don't wear helmets, I've no idea why." >}}

We hop in our bus to go up the mountain a bit. On the way, we pass the largest of the swings that make the tribe famous. The swings are used during various festivals.

{{< figure src="tribebigsqing.jpg" alt="Big swing in a field" caption="This swing is the largest in the country, and was built entirely by hand." >}}
