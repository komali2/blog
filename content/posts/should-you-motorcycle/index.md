I have thoughts on this and sometimes people ask me about it, so, should you
motorcycle? Almost assuredly. Here's why:

## It's the Best Mode of Transportation 80% of the Time <a id="efficient">

The other day, Tammy and I went to Berkeley for food and the Botanical Gardens.
This involves getting out of the city,
onto the Bay Bridge,
through Eastbay traffic, parking for breakfast somewhere in the middle of
Berkeley long enough to eat, and then driving again
way up into Berkeley hills.
Just getting across the bridge into Berkeley
is anywhere between a 35 minute to 1 hour drive
depending on traffic - unless you're on a bike.
Between being able to skip past
traffic light and freeway entrance traffic, and lanesplitting, we made it there
in a cool 30 minutes.
Instead of spending another ten minutes looking for parking, we parked
straight in front of the brunch place we wanted to go to - almost no spot is too
small for a bike, we can park at the edges of driveways or in between parked
cars.
After the Botanical Gardens,
we wanted to get tea at Asha,
our favorite tea place in Berkeley.
If we were in a car, forget about it.
Trying to find parking at 5pm in downtown Berkeley? Nah.
But once again, pulled straight in and sat down without a hiccup.

So in short, *especially* if you live in a city, nothing beats a bike. You can:

1. Lanesplit, dramatically reducing the time of any freeway commute
2. Filter at a traffic light, shaving off ridiculous time for any drive
in a city or where you need to enter/exit freeways.
3. Park literally anywhere. Be it in a motorcycle designated space, at the edge
of streetside car parking, in between cars, or in fucky weird places where
cars just can't go, like alleys or edges of the sidewalk.

The convenience can't be overstated.
When I want to go somewhere, I hop on my bike, drive there, and get off my bike.
I get ridiculously stressed about parking so it's a dream.
Wish I had one back in school.

But what if it rains? What if it snows? Sure, yea, you might have to take a Lyft
sometimes. Oh well. So 80% of the time your life is way more convenient, and
sometimes you hop in a taxi. Not a strong counterargument in my opinion.

But what if groceries? Get a GIVI box. I'll write an article later on how
to make motorcycle life way easier.

But what if passenger? Get a spare helmet and be that person that picks people
up on a bike. If your passenger is a date, congratulations, you've just
established yourself as cooler than almost the entire city's worth of singles.


## It's Fun <a id="fun">

I didn't mention this previously, but going to Berkeley the other day wasn't
just a drive to Berkeley.
We also got to be on the back of bikes, hauling across the Bay Bridge, then
crossing up into the mountains.
I've almost never had a bad time on my bike.
Even a simple route is a small joy.
I'm not talking, like, wind through hair or feel of the open road, I never
really understood that Zen And shit, I mean more like the entire process
of motorcycling is one of constant improvement.
On a small ride you'll find yourself making your slow turns better, maybe
wiggling in your lane a bit, maybe trying out an emergency stop.
Generally speaking the city will find some new thing to throw at you
that you get to add to your toolbox - a pothole, a ped running into the street,
some new turn angle at some new speed, etc.
It's a neverending practice set that you see improvement in literally every time
you get off the bike.

Also, cornering a bike is fun. It pretty much always feels badass to be leaning
through a turn.

Also, if you're not just *going* somewhere, you can ride for the sake of riding.
Up into some mountains if you're geographically blessed.
That's fun enough of an activity that people rent for the sole purpose of doing
so, and if you've got your own bike you can just do it whenever you want.

## There's a Community <a id="community">

To enjoy community is to be human. Whenever I pass another biker and get the two
fingers down, it's an inescapable burst of dopamine. No way around it. Coming
from a pretty independent dude that scoffed at that kinda shit all my life.

There's group rides, meetups, friends that can only be had if you've got a bike.
As much as I want as many people as possible riding, we're still a relatively
sparse population.
That leads inevitably to a tight kinship with anybody else you see on a bike,
which is fun.
Not to mention, it can come with ancillary benefits - maybe someone in an
interview rides and you get a leg up, maybe you meet a potential partner at a
group ride, maybe you buy a nice used watch off someone on the Bay Area Rider's
Forum, maybe you find a rent controlled apartment, you never know.

## Pretty Much Every Aspect of it is Cool <a id="cool">

You can try to argue otherwise if you want but I won't hear it, it's cool
to ride a motorcycle. You look cool on it, you look cool in your gear, you look
cool fuckin with the bike in your driveway, it's a cool thing to do.

## Spiritual or Whatever Reasons <a id="spiritual">

Motorcycling can be scary.
I've yet to meet someone that didn't feel fear their first ride, and hasn't felt
fear in rides down the line.
That's a good thing.
If you're scared to ride a bike, and then you do it anyway,
and you *keep* doing it, that's a powerful bit of growth you've just done.
You've pushed your comfort zone out tremendously, and in doing so made more
things comfortable or at least uncomfortable-without-causing-panic, even if
those things aren't related to motorcycling.
So yea, you'll come out of the
process of learning to and acquiring your own motorcycle more confident, more
sure of yourself and your boundaries, and with further extended boundaries.

Also, so much of motorcycling is about control.
Not only do you need to control your posture, your speed through a turn, your
acceleration out of a light or out of a turn, your stop speed, your position
on a freeway, and all the other technicals that go into riding, you've also got
to maintain emotional control.
We've got no instincts to handle 45mph control of an engine strapped to two
wheels.
You've got to overcome baseline instincts while installing new ones.
If you panic on the back of a bike, you're probably going to crash.
If you're about to crash, and then panic, you're either going to fail to avoid
what might actually be an avoidable crash, or crash harder.
So every turn, every near miss, is an emotional control exercise.

The classic newbie's first crash is to go wide on a turn and either end up
in the shoulder, sliding on all the shit that ends up there, or panicking,
braking too hard, and highsiding themselves into orbit. If instead they
control their emotions, remember their training, *push* harder to get
through the turn, they'll likely make it.
That's what I had to learn - a sort of trust of the bike and the world.
I know that in a turn, if I'm going too fast and am going to go wide,
I have to just push, push, push and make it through.
Instinct will be screaming at me to hit the brakes, but that will just cause me
to straighten out and drive straight off the road, or highside.
Heart will be racing but it doesn't nothing to help so I had to learn to just
hold on.

When I started riding, sometimes I'd be on the freeway, completely surrounded by
cars, and feel a panic attack coming on. Bad place for it. I would have to
wrestle control, because what else can I possibly do?
Stop the bike right there?
Panic and probably crash?
Just drop the bike and die?
There's no choice left to me and so I learned more control than ever over those
kinds of feelings, and that control follows me in every aspect of life now.

So if you're looking to develop confidence, develop inner control and peace,
develop inner strength, develop emotional control, motorcycling is one of the
many methods available to you.
