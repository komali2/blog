I've always wanted to see sakura, or cherry blossom trees, in Japan. Despite my
years living in Asia and my many trips to Japan, I had always missed the short
few weeks the cherry blossom trees are in bloom. Tammy had always wanted to see
the country as well, so, we put a trip together.

## Pre-Trip Preparation <a id="preparation">

### Aquiring an International Driver's License <a id="international-dl">

### The Japan Rail Pass <a id="japan-rail-pass">
Something I had recalled from previous Japan trips was the convenience of the
[Japan Rail Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Rail_Pass). In short, it
allows unlimited riding of JR Group transportation services, *including the
Shinkansen!* The fact alone that it gets you on the Shinkansen, tickets for
which run about $140USD ($280USD roundtrip), make it worth it, as it costs about
$300USD for 7 days. Tammy and I had to fenangle the dates a bit as we were in
Japan for about 9 days, but because you can "activate" your Pass at your leisure,
it was no issue to plan our trip around this (they also have 14 and 21 day pass
options).

Getting the Pass can be a headache to figure out, because in typical Japan
beaurucracy fashion, it can't just Be Easy. You've got to buy an Exchange Order
from any number of the approved travel agencies, *before* your arrive in Japan.
There's some sort of trial period that allows you to buy in Japan, but at time
of writing that's in "extension" to March 31, 2019, so don't gamble on it.

The Japan Rail Pass let us not only ride the Shink

To make a long story short, we simply bought ours from [JRRailPass](https://www.jrailpass.com/),
traded the Exchange Order for our tickets (do not lose these!!) in Kyoto, and all
was kosher. If you're reading this many years after the original posting date of
early 2019, you may want to do a bit more research, the system may have been
overhauled.

## Osaka <a id="osaka"></a>
Osaka is a gastronomical paradise, something I don't think I'd appreciated until
I had Tammy with me to enable "showing off" what Japan had to offer. Perhaps being
older and less embarassesd at humiliating myself with my terrible Japanese
in a restaurant allowed me to experience more.

### Arrival and Getting to the Hotel <a id="osaka-hotel-one">
In any case, we landed in the early afternoon at Osaka Kansai Airport and fairly
leapt off the plane to begin the adventure.
