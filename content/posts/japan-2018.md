I've always wanted to see sakura, or cherry blossom trees, in Japan. Despite my
years living in Asia and my many trips to Japan, I had always missed the short
few weeks the cherry blossom trees are in bloom. Tammy had always wanted to see
the country as well, so, we put a trip together.

### The Japan Rail Pass <a id="japan-rail-pass">

## Osaka <a id="osaka"></a>
Osaka is a gastronomical paradise, something I don't think I'd appreciated until
I had Tammy with me to enable "showing off" what Japan had to offer. Perhaps being
older and less embarassesd at humiliating myself with my terrible Japanese
in a restaurant allowed me to experience more.

### Arrival and Getting to the Hotel <a id="osaka-hotel-one">
In any case, we landed in the early afternoon at Osaka Kansai Airport and fairly
leapt off the plane to begin the adventure.
