I've always wanted to see sakura, or cherry blossom trees, in Japan. Despite my
years living in Asia and my many trips to Japan, I had always missed the short
few weeks the cherry blossom trees are in bloom. Tammy had always wanted to see
the country as well, so, we put a trip together.

## Pre-Trip Preparation <a id="preparation">

### Aquiring an International Driver's License <a id="international-dl">
Renting a motorcycle in Japan, at least from the agency we went with, requires an international
driver's license. [AAA](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html) provides this. The important
thing for motorcyclists is getting the license stamped as a "motorcycle license," which when
we did it meant having a stamp on the "A" portions of all the various languages. Note though
that it wasn't good enough to have it stamped in just one, the shop wanted it stamped in *all*
of them. So, when you go to AAA, have them stamp each and every "A" in that little book.

### Booking a motorcycle <a id="motorcycle-booking">
The agency we went with was [Rental819](https://www.rental819.com/english/).
We chose their Kanto: Odaiba location because it was one of their largest English
speaking shops in the Tokyo area. It worked out well because we could get off the
Shinkansen one stop earlier than the main Tokyo station. They rented us a
motorcycle, two helmets, two pairs of gloves, and two jackets. Pants and boots we had to
bring ourselves. They also included a toll card. The total came to about $310USD.

### The Japan Rail Pass <a id="japan-rail-pass">
Something I had recalled from previous Japan trips was the convenience of the
[Japan Rail Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Rail_Pass). In short, it
allows unlimited riding of JR Group transportation services, *including the
Shinkansen!* The fact alone that it gets you on the Shinkansen, tickets for
which run about $140USD ($280USD roundtrip), make it worth it, as it costs about
$300USD for 7 days. Tammy and I had to fenangle the dates a bit as we were in
Japan for about 9 days, but because you can "activate" your Pass at your leisure,
it was no issue to plan our trip around this (they also have 14 and 21 day pass
options).

Getting the Pass can be a headache to figure out, because in typical Japan
beaurucracy fashion, it can't just Be Easy. You've got to buy an Exchange Order
from any number of the approved travel agencies, *before* your arrive in Japan.
There's some sort of trial period that allows you to buy in Japan, but at time
of writing that's in "extension" to March 31, 2019, so don't gamble on it.

The Japan Rail Pass let us not only ride the Shink

To make a long story short, we simply bought ours from [JRRailPass](https://www.jrailpass.com/),
traded the Exchange Order for our tickets (do not lose these!!) in Kyoto, and all
was kosher. If you're reading this many years after the original posting date of
early 2019, you may want to do a bit more research, the system may have been
overhauled.

## Osaka <a id="osaka"></a>
We landed at Osaka Kansai Airport and as our first task had to find a way to get
to whatever station was nearest our hotel. Tammy got to experience the measured
insanity that is the Japanese train system, and we managed to get a ticket for
a train that would take us straight to [Osaka-Namba Station](https://goo.gl/maps/DseKrxLodBB2).

Somehow I had no concept of Doutonbori before this trip and so as we skimmed the
edges of it on our walk I thought "oh, looks like a nice little alley of
restaurants for us to try later. So, we dropped our shit off and went for a walk.

### Arrival and Getting to the Hotel <a id="osaka-hotel-one">
In any case, we landed in the early afternoon at Osaka Kansai Airport and fairly
leapt off the plane to begin the adventure.

### Exploring Dotonbouri <a id="dotonbouri-one">
## Nara <a id="nara"></a>
En route to Kyoto from Osaka, stopping at [Nara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara)
was a natural choice, especially as we hadn't activated our JR Passes yet and were
still using local trains. It's famous for its (weirdly aggressive) deer, but far
more impressive are its temples and old architecture. One of the coolest things
we stumbled across in our half day there was the [Okumura Commemorative Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/gdiJmLU3mJQ2),
a sort of earthquake technology showpiece with a gorgeous mix of modern and
ancient Japanese architecture. The whole building is supported on an engineering
firm's apparently patented earthquake-resistant support pillars, which you can see
for yourself if you head beneath the building.
