In the process of working at AIESEC, acquiring a Creative Writing degree, and participating
in my fair share of hackathons, I've had to do a lot of brainstorming. Brainstorming is
a method of generating ideas about a certain topic or objective. Brainstorming allows you
to generate a lot of ideas quickly by removing barriers, such as questioning ideas one at a
time for their feasibility. I've also noticed that a brainstorming session can lead to very
unique ideas being generated.

So, I'd like to get on paper what my brainstorming process looks like. I've developed this method
through extensive classroom time in writing workshops, supplemented it with lord knows how many books
and articles on writing-focused topics such as breaking through writer's block, and honed it through
tens of hackathons and hundreds of meetings.

I suggest following this method because it will give you a large pool of ideas for your given
topic or objective, leading to a greater likelihood that the "best" idea for your situation
is captured. Furthermore, this method helps, in group settings, ensure that a more diverse
pool of ideas will be generated, as all team members will have an opportunity to present
their ideas. Finally, this method gives you and, in a group setting, your teammate's inherent
creativity a chance to shine, the results of which you will probably see at the end of the session
when you walk away with a really good idea.

* Define a topic or objective
* The brainstorming session
* Editing


# Structure of a Brainstorming Session

My brainstorming method works best inside of a "session." A brainstorming session is made up of
three parts: 1: Defining a topic or objective, 2: idea generation, and 3: Editing. I will
go into more detail below. The result of the first step is both a clarity of purpose, as well
as a key piece of structure for the following steps of your brainstorming session. The result
of idea generation is a large list of ideas, which, depending on your objective, is then taken
to step 3, wherein ideas are discussed, cleaned up, defined, combined, and otherwise modified
to result in the result of step 3, which is a good list of ideas (or single idea) that can
then be implemented.

# Define a Topic or Objective

While the primary method of action of my brainstorming style is to remove all obstacles, which are
often beaurucratic (for example, formal project management flows causing ideas to stagnate on a JIRA
board somewhere or something), the process still requires rigidity in specific aspects. Specifically,
you must have a strongly defined topic or objective. You might think this will be an obstacle to your
creativity during the actual brainstorming the session, but quite the opposite. Constraints can
lead to greater creativity, and at the very least, more productive creativity. I like to think of it
as: a wide river typically moves slower and in fact moves *less* water than a narrow (but deep) one.
That's a simplification to allow for metaphor - fluid dynamics engineers stay off my back.

A brainstorming session can be guided by other a topic or an objective. An objective would be good to use
in situations such as project meetings attempting to solve a specific problem, product meetings trying
to capture certain customers, or hackathon team or individualss targeting specific prize categories. Objectives
are good for session where you need to come out with one or very few ideas at the end of the session. Topics
can be a bit more vague, such as a couple generating vacation ideas, an individual generating ideas for
a five year plan, writers generating prompts for themselves, engineering teams generating application pain points,
or software architects generating ideas for less-defined solutions spaces such as choosing database structures. Topics
are good for situations where you can come out of the session with few or more ideas.

Here are some examples of brainstorming session objectives:

* A game being developed needs a main character. Objective: Create a diversely appealing character that can feasibly develop rocket-boots.
* A pitch needs to be decided for a new product. Objective: Create a pitch for the salespeople to use.
* You need a Dungeons and Dragons character. Objective: Create a character that would feasibly have some form of knowledge of the city of Baldur's Gate and is not Evil aligned.
* Your marketing team wants a means of pushing products announcements. Objective: Determine a method/medium for announcing product changes.
* Your application traffic is increasing exponentially. Objective: Determine a method of scaling to match traffic.
* You are a writer determining character backstory. Objective: Determine what in a character's history would lead the given character to be motivated to later typically choose violence as a solution to their problems.

Here are some examples of brainstorming session topics:

* You are a Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master and need to fill a maze with content. Topic: Puzzles, enemies, and encounters befitting a secret prison beneath Baldur's Gate
* You are an author and need to populate a map befitting your fantasy setting. Topic: Cities that would arise in a continent where salt is the most valuable commodity, but also there's dragons.
* Your team's CEO has directed you all to bring them monetization strategies for your app. Topic: How can we monetize our screwdriver-size-finding app?
* You are a design team generating logos to be voted on by the company at large. Topic: What logos capture our company's culture and niche?
* You and your partner want to go on vacation. Topic: Where would be fun (and fiscally feasible) to go on vacation this summer?
* You are planning a hackathon and need to figure out to whom you can advertise the hackathon. Topic: What local meetups and groups would be interested in attending our hackathon?

Don't get too caught up on the difference between a topic or objective. The idea is that you want to be
able to write at the top of a chalkboard or whiteboard (if in person) or document (if remote) a relatively
clear target around which your ideas will be generated.

On that note, once you have your topic or objective, get it written down somehow, in a way
that everyone attending the session can see. It should be the largest and most visible
bit of text (or imagery) on the medium that you are using to record ideas.
