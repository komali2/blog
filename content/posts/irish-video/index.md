Like I pointed out in [my previous riding video post](/posts/wulai-ride-video), now that we're in level 3 COVID-19 lockdown here, I have a lot of time, and am finally making my way through my HUGE backlog of motorcycle videos that needed editing. The latest one is [this ride that Tammy and I went on with our friend Irish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooCK1LSWK88). Irish rides a Ducati Scrambler which is a pretty big bike for Taiwan, but she's pretty deft on it. We ride around [YanMingShan](https://goo.gl/maps/63uaBoc4f1h3anDd9), and it's especially gorgeous due to this being filmed back in May, during cherry blossom season for Taiwan. We also check out [Jianbaoli old market street](https://goo.gl/maps/uWvxbne7Tg7hyTVb8) near Yehliu Geological Park, as well as a beach. Irish also showed us some [really cool cafes](https://goo.gl/maps/LFVc6VbUnKgvXbWJ6) on the north coast that I really want to visit again once covid is over, because they seem like the digital nomad's dream working location!
