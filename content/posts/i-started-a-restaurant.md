Some friends and I opened a Southern Fried Chicken Biscuit restaurant in Taipei. It's called The é›ž Spot and is near Taipei City Hall Station.

Expect more posts to follow. I'm working on a couple big ones, including how we opened a restaurant here, how we started a business in Taiwan, and all the other insane shit we went through opening a restaurant. Those are taking a while to write, mostly because I now run a restaurant as well as a [software engineering co-op](https://508.dev), but also because I want to get them full of as much useful info as I can. In the meantime I needed to get something up on my blog talking about this because it's seriously wild, I can't wait to expound more on all the stuff I'm learning through this process that I think is weirdly applicable to my main career of software engineering.
