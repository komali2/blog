I recently moved to Taiwan on the Gold Card visa, and I've lived and worked here before.
In this post, I'm going to try to convince you to do the same.

Perspective matters. I'm writing this as a white guy, an American, in my early 30s, no kids, and as a software engineer.
Not that you need to be any combination of those things for this post to apply to you, but I want to
acknowledge that some of my reasoning may not apply to you, that some aspect of your life
may nullify my arguments, or perhaps make an even stronger case for why you should come here. There could be reasons
I haven't considered to come here! (for example, a friend in Venezuela has a strong argument to view Taiwan as a place
of political asylum)

## The Economic Argument

It's kind of against my nature to start from an economic perspective, but the reality is that it's one
of the strongest reasons to come out here.

The cost of living to the quality of living ratio is the best out of any country I've lived in, which
includes the USA (Wisconsin, South Carolina, Texas, California), Japan, China, and Vietnam. The last
time I lived here, I did a [blog post](http://ablate.blogspot.com/2014/05/what-does-it-cost-to-live-in-asia.html)
on my financial breakdown. Of course, that was back in 2014, and I was living as a grungy 22 year old
guy in a 3 bedroom with a bunch of roommates, but it was a pretty nice place and I had a great life.
I was working 12 hours a week making something like $2,000 USD a month teaching English, and just $200 USD
of that went to rent. Tammy and I are in the range of $1,7000 USD per month for a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom
luxury apartment located close to an MRT station, and that's *before* we negotiate rent down.

A regular lunch is between $1 and $3 USD. Boba tea is usually around $1 to $2 USD. A ride on the train is usually around $1 USD. Meanwhile, the mean engineering salary for Taiwanese citizens is $42,000 USD per year.
Sure it doesn't sound like much, but if your rent is $500 (easily doable) and your lunch is $3...

Also worth considering, for us Americans - you will pay about 10% of your healthcare costs, for equivalent
quality healthcare. Even less when you live here for 6 months and get on the nationalized health insurance,
or, get a job for a Taiwanese company. It's a single payer state health insurance scheme that everyone
pays into. Every doctor I've ever interacted with had some part of their education in the USA, and
the quality of the facilities is on par with the USA, minus the shitty parts of the American hospital
designed to extract money from you and seek profitability. The life expectancy in Taiwan is 80.9 years.
In the USA, it's 78.5.

But what about tax! 20% income tax rate on the first $86,419 USD that you make, after that it's a progressive
tax rate applied on the difference between each bracket (kinda similar to the USA). That's before you apply
any discounts you get as a foreigner, depending on what visa you come in on. Consider your health insurance
bill monthly is something like $8 USD, if you aren't putting more cash away in Taiwan than you are in the USA,
you are must be actively trying not to.


# It's Easier Than You Think

Coming here is far easier than you may think. I'll go through the common concerns I hear.

First, visa requirements. Right now because of coronavirus, the only way you're getting in is with
a working visa, which basically means the Gold Card Visa. I'll do up a whole post on that later, but the long
and short of it is if you have, at some point in the last 3 years, made $5,330 USD in one month from an employer
in your country or in Taiwan, you're automatically eligible. There's other categories as well, like arts, sciences,
etc, but the "economic" one is most common. If the economic category applies to you, it's a straightforward,
undemanding application process that takes a couple months before you get your entry permit, and then
you have three unrestricted years in Taiwan to do pretty much whatever you want. Work for a Taiwanese company,
work for an overseas company, whatever. Any sector, any job. Perhaps you don't even work at all - although that
goes against the spirit of the visa, and while it doesn't appear to necessarily be against the rules, that may
only be because of an oversight. Basically, don't count on not working at all!

That visa-requirement difficulty is only because of Coronavirus. If you're reading this post-covid, congratulations,
it's probably ridiculously easy for you to come here. If you're an American, there's no visa requirement to come to
Taiwan - you can show up and stay for 3 months, no questions asked. Then, you can pop out for a weekend in Hong
Kong, fly back in, and restart your timer for another 3 months. Plenty of time to find a job and get a long term visa. Or not,
and you simply remote work. Note on that - that's how it was, whether it remains that way remains to be seen. Double
check before you start buying plane tickets!

Second, working and making a living for yourself.
Worse case scenario, teach English. Hop on Facebook, search "English teaching job Taiwan," and
you should be presented with multiple Facebook groups where people are hiring teachers. Or, search for sub positions only,
do that for a few weeks to build up a network, and then see if one of the schools you substitute taught at will hire you
for a "full time" (read: 10-15 hours/week) position. Don't feel qualified? Don't worry about it. I won't say don't take
it seriously - as a teacher you have an outsized influence on children's psychology and learning, so don't mess around.
However, if you put in the effort and care, you'll already be better than 50% of the English teachers here. If you
have a college degree, you're a shoe in, and will have no trouble whatsoever getting a job. If not, it may be a bit harder,
but I've known people that didn't even graduate highschool that managed to make it work. Expect pay of around $1000 to $3000
USD depending on how many hours you work, which is more than enough to survive in Taiwan.

That's merely a backup plan by the way. There's plenty of "normal" jobs here as well. Taiwan is a burgeoning tech hub,
and as I write this I'm watching hordes of tech workers come in here and boost the science and technology scene. When
I last lived here, I knew foreigners doing everything from marketing, to running a kitchen, engineering, military
contracting, hell I even knew a guy that made a living selling greek yogurt that he made in his apartment. Because
the cost of living is so low, it's pretty easy to find your way here.

Concerned about Mandarin? That's a fair fear, especially for English speakers that have never picked up another language.
Now, I don't recommend this, but you can live a whole life in Taiwan without ever learning the most basic of Mandarin. I knew
a couple of guys like that when I last lived here. I only say this to demonstrate why you shouldn't worry. The idea is,
these guys were able to work, eat, find friends and partners, without speaking any Mandarin, because Taiwan is highly
internationalized and very welcoming. That being said, these guys also were very much looked down upon. As a white dude
living here, my own values tell me that it'd be pretty exploitative and disrespectful to come out here to take advantage
of the incredible economic opportunities and not even bother to learn the local language. When it does come time to learn
the language, have no fear, it really is easier than you'd think. I found it easier to learn than Spanish, even though
it's a non-phonetic writing system. I'm no polyglot either, chances are you'll have a much easier time than I did.


# It's a Good Life

Life in Taiwan is good.

The weather is tropical. Ever been to Hawaii? The beaches and water here are cleaner, and we have oodles of them. Like
the rivers in Colorado? Here they're as clean and cold as a spring, wherever you go. Mountains in the middle
of cities, snaked with hiking trails. Clubs that for a $20 USD cover get you an experience equal to something that would
cost you at least a hundred in Japan, or a thousand in New York or Vegas. Indie music scene. Indie art scene. Indie
film scene hungry for foreign actors. Quite literally the best motorcycling I've ever had, and I've been over Japan,
the French Riviera, end to end in Vietnam, and all over California.

Friends are easily made. Expats itching for adventure and community combined with locals addicted to activity
guarantee it.

The transportation system leaves you no excuses for a day trip to the beach, hot spring, or river. For $1 USD and an hour and a half of your time you're on the East Coast with miles of beach to explore. For the same price and 30 minutes less
you're in the middle of a jungle hiking towards a water fall, or, on a mountain with a bicycle you rented for $2 USD
exploring unmarred road with a bike lane as fat as a king sized bed. Anywhere you want to go can be gotten to on a
bus or train, quickly. Failing that, you can splurge $10 USD on a taxi to get you there directly, on a whim.

Rock climbing, take your pick. Practice during the week in a state gym for $1 USD unlimited climbing time, and an extra
$1 USD to rent shoes. On the weekend, head out to the, god, untold *hundreds* of natural climbing walls. One of my goals
during my time here is to start mapping these out.

If you like music, you'll fit in. An EDM scene that, in my opinion, rivals San Francisco and Tokyo for sheer diversity,
if not production value. Music festivals for any genre. Underground rock clubs. Maybe the only thing they don't have out
here is a Country scene, and who gives a shit? Head out to CKS Memorial Hall on a week night and watch the b-boy kids
do their thing. Wednesday night, some jazz club somewhere will be having a swing dance night or jazz show.

All that text and I haven't even gotten to the night markets or boba tea yet ;) in case you didn't know, Taiwan's
night markets are famous. Hundreds of food stalls serving the most diverse array of food that I think can be
found anywhere in the world, nearly every single night, all throughout the country. Also, as the inventor of boba
milk tea, obviously the best of the best can be found here, easily and on nearly every street corner.

# The Political Argument

This is mostly me arguing to my fellow Americans here.

You should question your faith in the USA as a dependable, safe place to make a life for yourself. Two weeks
before I wrote this blog post, several thousand people attempted a violent insurrection that arguable failed
only because of the quick thinking of a single police officer that led the mob away from a room full of
congress-people, and a trigger-happy secret service agent that prevented the lynching of the Vice President. As a
Texan, I had to grit my teeth as my bloodthirsty congressional representative got on the news and lauded these
efforts to overthrow a free and fair election, and the fact that that man (Brian Babin) is still in office today
is the straw that broke the back of my faith in my country and my patriotism.

Throughout my life I've watched the US and state governments fail spectacularly to manage hurricanes, floods, and pandemics.
The US government has no plan for mass automation, it has no ability to mange the next pandemic. It couldn't
even protect its capital from a violent insurrection. Healthcare costs are out of control. 11,000,000 children go hungry.
And despite all this, soldiers remained stationed abroad, and we find the time to assassinate generals in other countries.
My tax dollars, to that? My life spent giving thousands to United Healthcare in the hope that my deductible is paid of
when I get cancer from poorly regulated food? No thanks.

Taiwan handled Covid-19 better than any country on earth. It had a case fatality rate of 0.82%, to America's 1.68%. There
have been 855 cases here, with a population of 23,780,000, to America's 24,000,000 cases to its population of 328,000,000.
I've watched Taiwan pull itself together quickly after earthquakes, landslides, a plane clipping the side of a skyscraper,
and floods.

In the face of incessant propaganda fake news attacks from China, the Taiwanese government established an entire
governmental department in charge of fighting fake news with fact checking. This has led to the development of an
[open source](https://g0v.tw/) tool that Taiwan is offering to other countries waging similar information wars (so,
all countries lol). Meanwhile I can take my pick of American politicians and find them repeating dangerous
conspiracy theories time and time again, with absolutely no consequence.

When I went to Black Lives Matter protests, I was called homophobic slurs and a race traitor. I watched fellow
protesters get the absolute shit beat out of them by the police for the crime of sitting in a park with a sign.
For the last two decades, I cared enough to fight to improve my country. I won't try to argue that America
is a lost cause, but to me, I give the fuck up. Why try to glue together a broken mirror? The country doesn't
want to heal.

If you're tired too, there's no shame in trying to contribute to the world from somewhere else. Here in Taiwan,
every improvement is shared. When Taiwan had a surprlus of PPE, it tried to share it with the world. When it
developed methods of fighting fake news, it turned those efforts into open source software and again, tried to
share it with the world.

This is a peace-loving country that has never sent intelligence agents into foreign countries to overturn democracies,
prop up dictators, or train guerillas. There is no NSA super-surveillance. There is no "no-constitution" zone. No
criminalization of encryption algorithms. It doesn't have a perfect history, but today, it is far more ethical a government
than the USA has, in my opinion, *ever* had.

All we gotta do is legalize weed here and we're good to go!
