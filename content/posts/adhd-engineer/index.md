Six years in now as an engineer, and I really wish I could teach what I've learned to highschool-Caleb. It's funny to think of how hard I struggled: to be productive, to be a good teammember, to keep my head above water at work, all while knowing I had ADHD but without really thinking about tackling my problems with that in mind.

As a kid I was drawn to computers, programming, math, and science, but lost interest into middleschool and highschool, becuase I did terribly in the subjects. I thought it was because I just "wasn't good at math," and as I've said in [my various posts about my coding bootcamp experience](/tags/bootcamp), not only is that not really a valid obstacle to software engineering as a career, it wasn't even true in my case. I wasn't "bad at math," I was just a bad student with nigh-untreated ADHD.

Managing my ADHD effectively unlocked a dream career for me, and allowed me to do this job better than many, and I want others to have this possibility.

Obstacles from ADHD require unique solutions that may be counterintuitive to the usual advice people find when they're struggling with focus, discipline, productivity, or happiness. I want to share how I manage these issues today.

* General Mindset
* Staying Focused while Learning Things
* Learning Things
* Getting Work Done

Before getting into specifics, I think it'll help to have an overview of the problem space and the general strategies that'll be applied.

For me, ADHD has meant:

* Brain fog, sluggish thoughts
* Difficulty recalling people's names or specific words or syntax
* Forgetting dates and times or losing track of time, missing meetings, events, etc
* Addictive tendencies towards bite-sized cognitive activities, such as Twitter, Reddit, Youtube
* Extreme fatigue when presented with large multi-part tasks
* Inability to prioritize, decision fatigue, decision overload
* Tendency to hyperfocus, rabbithole, or work on something that doesn't really need working on
* Inability to break concentration from something to listen to someone else
* Inability to process long spoken dialogue
* Inability to process long written passages
* Extreme discomfort when meant to sit still for long periods of time
* Tendency to daydream
* Procrastination and the associated guilt
* Inability to bear in mind bigger pictures or larger goals when "in the moment"
* Outbursts of strong emotion

I could spend a lot of time writing about how all sorts of people have the above problems, or argue about how ADHD is unique in some of its required solutions, but I just don't care to do that, nor do I care to convince anybody about it being a real disease or whatever. Here, I simply want to talk to people with ADHD about how we can best manage our challenges.

I've picked these strategies up over the years by reading a shitload of self help books, as well as talking to therapists, psychologists, and other people with ADHD. If you've done the "self help book circuit," you've seen a lot of this information already. Hopefully the added context and examples will still be useful for you.

# Core Strategies

First off, some things that will help with basically every symptom of ADHD I've struggled with.

## Sleep


You gotta get enough sleep. 8 hours. Why do people always need convincing of this? The difference should be night and day, just so blatantly obvious to anybody that's stayed up later than they should. I almost wonder if it's because the majority of us never get enough sleep, so we don't realize how much better it is when one is well rested. Now that I'm 31 and have been paying close attention to this sort of thing for the last decade or so, it's remarkable how much my symptoms are exacerbated when I don't get my 8 hours. I'll swap between impenetrable brain fog and nauseatingly fast racing thoughts. I'll feel like laying on the floor and going straight to sleep when I look at my todo list. I'll be visibly bored and uncomfortable in meetings, and will simply fall asleep in class. I'll be far more likely to have an emotional outburst.

So, you've heard it a million times, but please heed it: above all else, all other priorities, all other needs, please get your 8 hours of sleep.

How? I went through a whole mess of sleep tweaking in my early 20s, and it's paid dividends. I [even wrote a blog post way back in 2014](/posts/how-i-am-curing-my-sleepiness/) about sleeping better. Specifically regarding ADHD, I think a primary obstacle was letting go of wanting to be entertained and engaged. I'd be feeding input into my brain straight till midnight, and then try to wake up at 7 so I could have more time in the day (which I would waste by procrastinating). Having a whole formalized ritual around sleep quality, enforced by the authority of a sleep doctor I was seeing a decade ago, has helped.

The basic tenants are to have established tiems for going to bed, falling asleep, sleep, and waking up. Mine are 10pm for bed, 11pm for sleep, and 7am for wakeup.

A regular schedule allows your body to set a rigid circadian rhythm that will have you, after even just a few weeks, feeling sleepy when you need to be sleepy, and wide awake when you need to be awake, with no "4pm sleepies" (the bane of my university experience). Obviously, the schedule should have 8 hours between the sleep and wakeup times. My doctor advised an hour between the bed and sleep times.

"Bed time" means beginning the full ritual of preparing to sleep, and finishing with enough time to spare to allow you to get your head on the pillow and eyes closed a good 15 or 20 minutes before your "sleep" time. So for me that means I'm off all screens at 10pm sharp, no exceptions. I brush my teeth then, get into bed, and read my kindle for a bit, preferably fiction (tip taken from Tim Ferris). I try to put it away by 10:40, put my head to the pillow, and get to sleep.

A recent addition for me has been Headspace meditiations. Pandemic in the USA was stressing me to the breaking point, and I was getting nightttime panic attacks. I discovered Headspace "sleepcasts" as a solution to that, but now I still use them because of how effective they are at putting me *straight* to sleep. I pop in earbuds with the sleepcast on and am usually asleep within minutes of it starting. If I wake up in the middle of the night and the sleepcast has finished, I switch to some white noise. Combined, with these, I sleep like a baby, even through Tammy's comically loud snoring. She's so small. I just don't understand the physics there.

I also recommend trying an eye mask having no caffeine 7 hours before sleep time (4pm for me), and not having any food or alcohol 3 hours before sleep time.

## Medication

Choosing to medicate is a huge decision that basically comes down to what you and your doctor think are best for you. Don't try to go down this route on your own. It may be easy to get adderall without a perscription, but you really need to be talking with your doctor as you go through dosage determination and keeping an eye on side effects. However, one thing I don't like is how in the USA some doctors adopt a strategy of prescribing the largest possible dosage, and then reducing dosage until side effects go away. I prefer the reverse: doing the smallest possible dosage, and working up until the issue being treated is managed enough to have leveled the playing field for me and my other management strategies.

Anyway, I've treated my ADHD with both adderall and ritalin, and I really have no preference between either. I will say that every time I tried getting *off* my medication, my work would be affected to the point where I'd be put on probation or having stern conversations with management about my productivity. So I personally consider it a requirement for me having a normal life. Without medicine, my thoughts are sluggish enough for me to notice and be frustrated by it. My vocabulary is noticeably worse, I struggle to think through engineering problems, and I basically become a zombie in meetings.

If you haven't tried medicating your ADHD yet, perhaps consider a conversation with your doctor about it.


## Meditation

Daily meditation has dramatically improved many aspects of my life and psychology, but I'm actually not yet so sure how much of an effect it's had specifically on my ADHD symptoms. That said, it's technically a way to practice focusing, and not letting distractions or intrusive thoughts control your brain, or for your brain to race away, so I recommend it. Just 5 minutes a day is time anybody can spend on a meditation experiment. Do some googling to learn how, or watch some guided youtube videos. The important thing I think is to give it time to work. I was skeptical until after about two weeks of consistent meditation, and then I was able to determine the difference between a day in which I meditated, and one I didn't.

Meditation did help very well with emotional control, to where I almost never now have the emotional outbursts that plagued me as a child and young man, and were one of the worse manifestations of ADHD for me.


# Staying Focused While Learning and Doing Things

My first major strides in managing my ADHD came when I was preparing for a programming bootcamp. I had to absorb an enormous about of information about Javascript, web development, and general computer science, and then use that knowledge to do things like pass coding bootcamp interviews or complete pre-course homework. However, in this pre-course time, there's no teachers, no curriculum really, not even an actual deadline (you can apply for whatever cohort however many months away you want). It was on the surface a nightmarish situation for someone with ADHD: total self-reliance, no guard rails. So I thought. Turns out I'm more reliable than I thought.

An unstructured environment gave me the space I needed to organize myself in my own way, and that's something I wish I had been given the opportunity to do much earlier in life.

So how does one stay focused when one needs to, say, learn enough Javascript to pass a coding bootcamp interview?

1. Identify the objective
2. Establish a strategy
3. Create learning / working spaces
4. Manage Emotions

## Identify the Objective


Lots of self help books talk about this, and typically the advice given about objectives is it should be clear and testable. "Lose weight" isn't a good objective, nor is "learn Javascript." "Achieve 15% bodyfat" is a good objective, "Achieve 15% bodyfat by July" is better, because it has a deadline, which can lend focus. "Achieve 15% bodyfat by July so I can feel sexy at the beach" is best, because it includes *why* you're doing something, which is important for motivation. My objective was "be able to pass a Hack Reactor bootcamp interview by (some date) so I can go to the bootcamp," which tied into a greater goal of "go to a bootcamp in 2015 so I can be an engineer by 2016," which tied into a greater goal of "be an engineer as my next job so I can be free to work abroad, remote, get paid better, set my hours, create things, etc etc."

Testing whether I can pass a Hack Reactor interview became easy after I failed one - I would just occassionally try to write a big set of lodash.js functions without looking up help. Throughout my engineering career, things wouldn't be as clear. Maybe my goal for a day would be to get a certain chunk of work done, which depending on the project management setup, "done" may not always be well defined. This is simply another skill I'll need to continue growing. At very least, I need to set the objective.

Sometimes an objective is huge: "build an app." For example, after graduation, [I recommend creating a personal project](/posts/bootcamp-job-search/#the-personal-project) to showcase and grow your practical engineering skills. Following my advice can seem vague and monumental. "Build what app, and how?" Sometimes your objective can be a bit vague like that, and can be clarified in another important aspect of managing ADHD as an engineer: Establishing a strategy.

## Establishing a Strategy
