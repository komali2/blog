"The Culture" series is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series">huge collection of pretty darn long novels</a>Â about what is essentially the human race tens of thousands of years in the future traveling around the galaxy and doing their thing. They've formed into a conglomerate known as "The Culture" that consists mostly of humans, AI "Minds," and a select amount of other species. This conglomerate is pretty much the only thing that connects the novels - characters are not seen novel to novel, although some events from previous books are mentioned in later ones.
