Hopefully I'll publish my 2023 reading list less than a year after 2023 ;)

Here's what I read last year, generally in order of how my personal enjoyment:

## "Too Like the Lightning", Ada Palmer

My absolute favorite series I read in 2022 and now among my favorite books of all time (alongside Walkaway, Cryptonomicon, Prince of Nothing, Blindsight). Expertly written in style and technique, keeping me rooted through every single book in the series without any dirty tricks or tired tropes. Totally unique. It presented ideas I hadn't encountered yet in Sci Fi, which is really rare at this point; most sci fi, no matter how unique, is working with at best a heavy modification of a known trope. Tied together Classics with the modern era. Unlike books like "Fall, or Dodge in Hell," it didn't necessarily add a lot to my library of "books I quote to demonstrate a point," but it did stick in my memory and stay there, especially with some of the values the various characters play with, which I came to admire. Absoultely must-read the whole series.

## "Reamde" and "Fall; or, Dodge in Hell", Neal Stephenson

[Reamde Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reamde).

This is a more fun than normal Stephenson novel that takes an ABRUPT left turn about 1/3 of the way through the book. Unlike its predecessor, "Cryptonomicon," and its sequel, "Fall; or, Dodge in Hell," no large techno-philosophical issues are tackled, and it doesn't leave me thinking as much as those or his other works do. But, it's good fun, and worth a read. One of my favorite books.

[Fall; or Dodge in Hell Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall;_or,_Dodge_in_Hell)

I quote thought experiments proposed in this book CONSTANTLY. Stephenson always manages to create scenarios and metaphors that are perfect to describe technological and philosophical issues we're dealing with today. This final book in a psuedo-trilogy does so better than most of his books, exploring transhumanism and "fake news" expertly. Also it's just straight fun. I recommend if for no other reason that to get up to date on some of the "tropes" being discussed around topics like open source, fake news, transhumanism, and philosophy of mind.

## "Bullshit Jobs", David Graeber

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs)

Maybe a good book to radicalize with. Points out some of the glaring contradictions in the modern capitalist system, such as the fact that the people with the most useful jobs (teachers, firefighters, etc) get paid the least, while the people with the least useful jobs (investment bankers, landlords) get paid the most. Filled with gems.

## "A Fire Upon the Deep" Vernor Vinge

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep)

I really liked the speed-of-thought concept this novel played with, and I want to read other books set in the same universe. A fun sci-fi that has a couple tropes it picks and drills into that are interesting to play with. I felt the concepts (linguistics, physics) were handled competently, never any handwaving magic. Also really fun to read about what the internet might look like as written by someone in in 1992. Aged well.


## "3 Body Series", Cixin Liu

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel))

Four books, three by Cixin Liu and a fourth by a fan called Baoshu. Very interesting to get a PRC perspective on scifi, especially as the beginning of the first book deals a lot with the Cultural Revolution.

A little disjointed, each book seems to imply a very different sort of story being told, though I liked that. There's some cringe to wade through with stuff like the over romanticization of character creation by writers, or like, a sometimes ridiculously han chauvinist treatment of female characters. Other than that it's a fun thought experiment of many different sci fi concepts that I haven't found much in other books, like its treatment of existing in multiple dimensions, computing, and universal civilizations. I'm annoyed that it's a bog standard reiteration of prisoner's dillema at parts, which I think is often a false dillema, but oh well.

## "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living", Dale Carnegie

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Start_Living)

A really good book for anyone to read, as it's quite short, but especially for those that aren't great at setting aside worries and focusing on things that need doing. Personally I had learned a lot of what was written from other books, therapists, or just stumbled onto it on my own, but it was still nice to have tips formally laid out. Not just for people who are "chronically worried," I think this book has good advice for every human.

## "Never Split the Difference", Chris Voss

[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123857637-never-split-the-difference)

A negotiation book written by a cop. Not total garbage, as it's useful to read how cops are trained to be uncompromising, and get a feel for the kind of chauvinistic questioning you might get at the hands of someone like this. The strategies in the book are percolating throughout the "self help" world, supplanting more empathy-based approaches proposed by people like Dale Carnegie. Good read just to keep abreast of this.
