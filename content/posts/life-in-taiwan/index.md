I've had enough people ask me the question now that it's going to get a blogpost: What's it actually like over here?

I've already argued strongly in favor of Taiwan [as a destination for immigration](/posts/why-taiwan**, but what about the day to day here? Where do I work, how do I work, what do I get up to for fun, do I actually have time for that sort of thing?

I'd already been reflecting on my past year, going through photos and journals, so for fun I'll write about what some of my days have been like here.

Bear in mind that I'm in a pretty extraordinarily privileged position. Taiwan was still amazing to me when I was just an English teacher not earning too much, but even then I had the advantage of a college degree, being white, speaking English, having a USA passport etc. So probably not everyone can have exactly this amazing of a life here in Taiwan, but for digital nomads, engineers, etc, it's more than accessible.

I'll write about some examples of days.

* Keeping Pets and Plants
* Going to the Gym
* Getting Coffee
* Working at Home
  * Internet
  * Furniture
  * Hardware
* Managing Remote Work with a USA Company
* Mandarin Lessons

Most of my days start out around 7am here. We've got a couple pets that I have to feed and take care of: fish, a bearded dragon, plants, etc. Our landlord was very open to all sorts of pets. In my experience pet-friendly apartments are about as common here as they were in San Francisco. Furthermore, there's a massive industry for petkeeping here, with whole streets dedicated to acquariums for example. Our bearded dragon isn't even that uncommon of a pet, and we have for example a vet that I can take him to only a 40 minute comibned walk / train ride, 20 minute car ride away. As for our plants, there's at least two enormous flower markets I'm aware of in Taipei, not to mention various plant shops. Taiwan is seemingly obsessed with domestic plant keeping, and every business and home seems overflowing with plants. For plant lovers, you really couldn't pick a better town. Not to mention the tropical environment means most plants thrive here.

Anyway, after our pets and plants are happy, I pop off to the gym. I have a World Gym a 5 minute walk from our apartment. This has been typical in my experience here, no matter where one lives, there's usually a well-stocked gym within a few minute jog. If you're really lucky, you'll be near one of the Public gyms, of which each "neighborhood" has at least one. My gym contains everything I can think anybody would need: ample squat racks, bench presses, dumbells, and bodyweight equipment, not to mention stuff I never use like treadmills, stationary cycles, various aerobic classes, hell they even have a boxing ring. And, of course, trainers. My monthly rate is about 30 USD / month, which is typical for Taipei. They also have towel service, showers, a hottub, and a sauna, though all of this was temporary closed during our recent COVID outbreka.

After a workout, I can grab a coffee to go from one of like a hundred cafes around us. Unfortunately, many cafes in Taiwan don't open until 10am or even later, so my choices are more limited if I get out of the gym around 830 or 9. If I'm supremely lazy, I can get a coffee delivered via uber eats in about 10 to 15 minutes for about 3 or 4 bucks USD. In my experience the coffee in Taiwan is excellent, and they make whatever drinks you're probably used to in your home country. Espresso machines are standard, plus many cafes are experimenting with pour-overs, coldpresses, and enormous, methlab-looking extraction systems. Plus, Taiwan has its own bean farms, and many cafes roast their own beans, so you can get unimported single origin coffee. Environmentalism!

Gym and coffee sorted, I shower, and yes we have hot water (someone asked; Taiwan is first world, people!) On this example day, I'll work from home. I grabbed a standing desk from Ikea for like 400$ USD when we first moved here, which was an excellent investment. I have hardwired 1G internet and my speedtests usually hover around there. This is costing us around 30$ USD a month. On the desk is a 4k monitor I bought online (pchome), attached to an adjustable arm stand I also bought online (shopee). If I wanted, I could have gone to Guanghua digital plaza and shopped in person for hardware.

My primary employer, Curative, is based in the USA, and I'm lucky enough to have a fully remote work setup with them. If I didn't have them, I could instead rely on contracts I was finding through friends. If I didn't have friends, I'm pretty sure I could chase up a good income pulling remote gigs through job websites like Stack Overflow or Angel.co.

Working remote has some quirks, so I'll outline my process to give an idea of what it's like and how Curative and I, as an example, make it productive.

Personally, being effective remotely requires a strong bit of organization and discipline. Nobody's around to catch you on reddit, hell, nobody's stopping you from just laying on the couch and playing Pikmin all day, at least until someone notices you haven't pushed code in a while. I am famously lazy, so this was a growth area for me. Using a shitload of org-mode magic that I've [blogged about before](/posts/my-emacs-environment) and will probably go into more detail on later, I have a daily todo list that's generated dynamically for a given day based on my tasks and schedule.

So, I boot up my pc, pull up my daily agenda, and get to it. My first item is usually:

```org
  curative-tasks:0:30  Scheduled:  TODO Check Slack, Github, Linear, create tasks for PRs etc :work:curative::

```

So, I look through Slack, check my threads and DMs, etc. At Curative, often people will post in Slack if they have an urgent pull requests, and because of time zones, I'm usually starting work just when the Californians are finishing up, so I can grab any last-minute urgent pull requests and review them. I don't do that yet though, I create todos and schedule them for "today" and link to the PR, until I've checked Slack, Github, Linear, Notion, etc. This might seem silly, but I've found that I have to be hella strict for task management to stay on top of my game out here.

My final task is unique to Curative and a flow I find works very well and recommend others try out: our various teams make Notion docs for daily standup. Allegedly they're also doing daily standup in the morning, and that's when they fill out the doc on a per-person basis, but for me I just fill it out asyncrounously as I work through the day. So, I take a look at that, the top of which has all the pull requests my team has pending for the day (not just the urgent ones I found in slack). If this is a Wednesday for example, my own standup for the previous day will be in this doc, because, you know, my present is their future, or whatever. I finish off by creating their "Tomorrow's" notion doc, where I'll be putting my "today's" work. Then, when they open up their standup doc tomorrow, they'll have my "today's" standup information available, can answer any questions I had come up during the day, leave comments, review my pull requests, etc.

Then, I work! I code or whatever until around 11:45, occassionally looking at our bearded dragon, Richard, or our fish, or the birds that dick around in our backyard. Today's a lazy day example, so I toss out an order on Uber eats for some local bento box place. My options are seemingly unlimited here, and I can usually get lunch to me in something like 30 minutes, 15 sometimes. Lunch is usually around 6 bucks USD delivered.

Depending on how much work I have an hour many hours I'm billing that day (occassionaly I don't bill full time for Curative in this example), I'll finish work around 2 or 3. From then, I can work on personal projects, or walk around outside and catch pikmin, or read, whatever.

At 5 I have an online mandarin lesson with a Taiwanese teacher that lives in the UK. The time zone difference works out well, though I agree that it's probably a little silly to be doing lessons with a Taiwanese person in another country. Even if she was here, though, I'd prefer the online lessons. Tammy sometimes does her mandarin lessons in person and it adds a lot of time to the thing for commute, small talk while buying coffee, etc. I use Preply for Mandarin lessons, and it costs 30$ USD/hr. I take two lessons a week and find it to be one of the best value for time and money activities I do in terms of leraning mandarin. It does need to be supplemented with other studies though, which I'll get into.

It's Wednesday in this example day, so I horf a quick uber eats dinner
