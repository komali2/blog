So, I thought I'd have to have a friend in the US post up blogs for me, but it seems that as long as I have access to email, I can just email blog posts to be posted automatically. I can do this for both my blog and the [aiesec houston](http://aiesechouston.blogspot.com) blog. That was me testing hyperlinks. And also, a picture.
