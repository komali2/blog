I get asked this a lot. Usually concerned friends back home catching some latest piece by a Comcast or Murdoch or Bezos media company on how the PRC is definitely super duper gonna invade Taiwan for real this time guys. Sometimes it's after an earthquake. Never mind that said friend is in the process of fleeing a forest fire.

I want to settle the question, because now that borders are open, Taiwan is starting to look like an unbeatable digital nomad spot, and if I hear one more person say "well I'd love to come work in Taiwan, but what about China?", I might scream.


# What About China?

Quick note, I'll refer to "China" as "the PRC" from here on out, because calling the PRC, China, allows them to weaponize the word and concept of "Chinese," which lets them further their soft imperialism against any nation that also shares Chinese heritage and culture. Expect a blog post about that soon.

So, what about the PRC? They're totally going to invade, right? I mean, they JUST YESTERDAY....

* did something with jets at some border
* said something about retaining the right to use force to invade Taiwan
* promised "reunification"
* had some communist holiday
* had a birthday party for a high level party official

right?

Sure, you probably saw on CNN that the PRC did a thing. That said, the PRC has been doing things forever.

Here are a list of events that didn't lead to PLA (People's Liberation Army, army of the PRC) invasions:

1. Taiwanese President Chen explicitly rejecting "One China" policy, 2001. PRC response: build some missile bases, threaten military action.
2. Hu Jintao, famous for violent oppression of Tibetan people, becomes Secretary General of the CPC, 2002. PRC actions: let Taiwan jets fly unhindered through PRC airspace during America's war with Iraq.
3. PRC 10th National People's Congress passes [Anti-Succession Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Secession_Law), setting down as law that Taiwan formal independence will be met with invasion. Result: 1 million Taiwanese march in protest, DPP proposes a bill that declares Taiwan to be a sovereign state (rejected at committee level), general international condemnation... and PRC increases peaceful contact with various groups in Taiwan, and Hu Jintao meets with Taiwan Vice-President elect directly in 2008.
4. Obama sells 6.4 billion USD worth of missiles to Taiwan. PRC reaction: military-to-military ties with USA temporarily cut, stern warnings issued.
5. DPP elected, doesn't acknowledge 1992 consensus, 2016. PRC reaction: Grumpy.
6. President Tsai of Taiwan prevents previous Taiwan President Ma from traveling to Hong Kong to deliver speech. Result: speech delivered on Zoom, and a few months later 8 Taiwan government officials visit Beijing without incident.
7. Xi says "we have sufficient ability to thwart any form of Taiwan independence attempts," 2017. Result: Taiwan media says this is status quo.
8. Various Taiwan Independence parties organize to get a referendum on official Taiwan independence, constitution change, and UN membership application. Result: PRC flies some jets around the strait.
9. US State Department "lifts self-imposed restrictions on USA-Taiwan relations," 2021. Result: protests in the PRC.
10. KMT Chairman rejects "one party, two systems" for Taiwan, 2021; Result: PRC flies some jets around Taiwan.
11. PRC bans Taiwanese pineapples from import. Result: Largest export of Taiwan pineapples in history, mostly to Japan.
12. Nancy Pelosi's robinhood app crashes, she flies to Taiwan to check on nvidia stock prices. Result: PRC flies some jets around Taiwan, releases hilariously bad photoshops of PLA boats in Taiwan Strait.

Long and short of it is for the last 20 years, anytime the PRC gets mad, they fly some jets around, and usually a few months later some new cross-strait economics talk happen, or a KMT official is sent to the PRC to do what the KMT do best: drink beer and slap their fat dad bellies with fat dad bellied communists.

I've talked with all sorts here about it. It's, perhaps unsurprisingly, a not-often-discussed issue, because many see it as such a non-issue. From our American Embassy (not an actual embassy) friends, of whom I got to talk to basically all at once at a going away party, the consensus is not only that PRC invasion is all but certainly not happening, if it *were* to happen, the signs would be far stronger, and we'd have plenty of warning. Their perspective is that the USA State Department is quite cynical when it comes to pulling out embassy staff, they usually jump the gun on it, so basically, until we start seeing embassy staff being pulled out of Taiwan, there's not really anything to worry about.

Local Taiwanese are skeptical. Economic relations between Taiwan and the PRC are too strong to justify destroying them utterly with an invasion, which would lead to self-sabotage of Taiwan productivity before the PRC could take over factories, chip manufacturies and the like. From an economic angle, there's just no good reason to do it. Invasion of Taiwan could very likely collapse the world economy, considering that manufacturing of anything involving a chip would have to halt.

Regardless, if anyone *knew* the actual risk of a PLA invasion, it would simply happen or not, because I highly doubt the CPC would order an invasion doomed to fail, which means to know an invasion is going to happen is to know an invasion would succeed at a worthy cost, and if that was known, the PRC would simply invade. They aren't invading, it isn't known, it's possibly unknowable. It's as unknowable as whether a deadly earthquake will hit, or hurricane, or pandemic. Which brings me to my next point:

# Philosophy of Avoiding Death

All of you are going to die, not me, but all of you will, at some point. The lucky amongst you (I stave off death eternally by drinking christian blood) will make it about 80 years, which is an incredibly short time but also not a bad run. By some measures, making it to 80 is a sort of accomplishment. Congratulations, you did it, you made it to the point where you basically can't make it any longer no matter what you do.

If your objective is to make it to that point, there's a lot of accidents you have to avoid, that are somewhat within your ability to avoid. You can dramatically increase your chances of making it to 80 by not smoking, for example, or by going on an occasional jog and eating reasonably healthy. Those don't really decrease your quality of life either, in fact they increase it. Other choices you can make increase your chances but arguably decrease your quality of life: only eating soylent, for example, or avoiding getting killed in a car accident, by a disease, or by a crazed axe murderer, by living in the middle of nowhere Indiana, eschewing all personal contact for fear of germs. Clearly, we're willing to make some sacrifices in favor of a fun 80 years or less, trading up some percent chance to hit that magic number.

So, what do you sacrifice? Are you willing to trade some percent likelyhood of making it to 80 against risk of disease, and thus spend time in person with other people? Are you willing to gamble a bit by occassionally eating unhealthy food? Drinking alcohol? Driving on the freeway to a concert, where you might get stampeded? Probably you are, because that's how you enjoy life.

Extend the argument: most of the fun places to live, if you enjoy being around people and going to shows and having a variety of things to do, are more dangerous than some rural nowhere. San Francisco gets earthquakes and choked out by forest fire smoke. NYC apparently floods and gets hurricanes now, as well as killing heat waves. Every city in Europe, same for the heat waves. Even if all you want to do is sit on the beach or a porch overlooking a corn field, good luck finding anywhere that doesn't carry risk of tsunami, hurricane, or tornado (or earthquakes, thanks fracking!).

In short, fun carries risk. All places to live carry similar apocalyptic danger... but do they all carry the same mundane danger?

# Actually, Taipei is Safer than Where You Live

I've been pulling a fast one this whole time. With the risk of a PLA invasion as essentially unestimable as any other apocalyptic risk, the true evaluation of the safety of Taiwan compared to wherever you live comes down to more mundane safeties, and you can't beat Taiwan for mundane safety.

Consider America, where most of my concerned friends are: a school shooting every day, totally overwhelmed by gun crime. Here's some depressing figures from the USA:

* Gun death was the leading cause of death for children 19 and younger in 2020. Remember, this is when COVID first hit, pre vaccine. Nice.
* America leads the high-income world by more than double for gun related deaths, when account for suicides
* Discounting suicides, there are 5.8 gun deaths per 100,000 Americans, per year, in 2019.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States#Statistics

Here's some stats for Taiwan:

* Discounting suicides, there are 0.6 gun deaths per 100,000 Taiwanese per year
* Since Taiwan has been a country, there have been 100 shootings total

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4597724

Honestly though, that isn't really fair. America's abysmal response to it's gun crime epidemic is just too easy a target. Depending on how you feel about being shot to death, basically anywhere on Earth that isn't a cartel hotspot is safer than America. Let's move to something more mundane: COVID-19.

At this point, we're all vaccinated (those that aren't generally can't read an will give strange answers to the question "what shape is the earth"), probably have gotten covid already, and survived. However, when the next one comes around (and it will), it's worth remembering which countries let a lot of their people die.

Covid Deaths Per 1 million people:

* USA: 3,265
* France: 2,386
* Germany: 1,821
* UK: 2,813
* Australia: 598
* Thailand: 472
* Israel: 1,260
* Canada: 1,199
* New Zealand: 630
* Taiwan: 520

When Tammy and I moved to Taiwan in 2021, the world was some combination of totally locked down, or dying en masse of covid. Taiwan had 0 covid, literally none, and we spent our time at bars and clubs while friends home were forced to essentially shelter in place as other societies completely failed to control the disease.

Now Taiwan's covid restrictions have mostly lifted, and it has since had an uncontrolled outbreak nearly 3 years after everyone else... but with most of the population vaccinated, combined with socialized healthcare, the death rates have been extremely low, despite the aging population.

This is repeatable, a point of Taiwan pride. When COVID-27 hits or whatever the next pandemic is, there's nowhere I'd rather be than the country that literally handled COVID-19 better than any other in terms of balancing quality of life against safety.

Talking about death so much is depressing, though. Safety doesn't just mean likelyhood of dying, it can mean other things too: How likely are you to be attacked? Robbed? Mugged? Burgaled? Had your stuff vandalized, stolen, taken by the government? In Taiwan, very unlikely.
