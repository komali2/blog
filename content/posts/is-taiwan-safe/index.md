I get asked this a lot. Usually concerned friends back home catching some latest piece by a Comcast or Murdoch or Bezos media company on how the PRC is definitely super duper gonna invade Taiwan for real this time guys. Sometimes it's after an earthquake. Never mind that said friend is in the process of fleeing a forest fire.

I want to settle the question, because now that borders are open, Taiwan is starting to look like an unbeatable digital nomad spot, and if I hear one more person say "well I'd love to come work in Taiwan, but what about China?", I might scream.


# What About China?

Quick note, I'll refer to "China" as "the PRC" from here on out, because calling the PRC, China, allows them to weaponize the word and concept of "Chinese," which lets them further their soft imperialism against any nation that also shares Chinese heritage and culture. Expect a blog post about that soon.

So, what about the PRC? They're totally going to invade, right? I mean, they JUST YESTERDAY....

* did something with jets at some border
* said something about retaining the right to use force to invade Taiwan
* promised "reunification"
* had some communist holiday
* had a birthday party for a high level party official

right?

Sure, you probably saw on CNN that the PRC did a thing. That said, the PRC has been doing things forever.

Here are a list of events that didn't lead to PLA (People's Liberation Army, army of the PRC) invasions:

1. Taiwanese President Chen explicitly rejecting "One China" policy, 2001. PRC response: build some missile bases, threaten military action.
2. Hu Jintao, famous for violent oppression of Tibetan people, becomes Secretary General of the CPC, 2002. PRC actions: let Taiwan jets fly unhindered through PRC airspace during America's war with Iraq.
3. PRC 10th National People's Congress passes [Anti-Succession Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Secession_Law), setting down as law that Taiwan formal independence will be met with invasion. Result: 1 million Taiwanese march in protest, DPP proposes a bill that declares Taiwan to be a sovereign state (rejected at committee level), general international condemnation... and PRC increases peaceful contact with various groups in Taiwan, and Hu Jintao meets with Taiwan Vice-President elect directly in 2008.
4. Obama sells 6.4 billion USD worth of missiles to Taiwan. PRC reaction: military-to-military ties with USA temporarily cut, stern warnings issued.
5. DPP elected, doesn't acknowledge 1992 consensus, 2016. PRC reaction: Grumpy.
6. President Tsai of Taiwan prevents previous Taiwan President Ma from traveling to Hong Kong to deliver speech. Result: speech delivered on Zoom, and a few months later 8 Taiwan government officials visit Beijing without incident.
7. Xi says "we have sufficient ability to thwart any form of Taiwan independence attempts," 2017. Result: Taiwan media says this is status quo.
8. Various Taiwan Independence parties organize to get a referendum on official Taiwan independence, constitution change, and UN membership application. Result: PRC flies some jets around the strait.
9. US State Department "lifts self-imposed restrictions on USA-Taiwan relations," 2021. Result: protests in the PRC.
10. KMT Chairman rejects "one party, two systems" for Taiwan, 2021; Result: PRC flies some jets around Taiwan.
11. PRC bans Taiwanese pineapples from import. Result: Largest export of Taiwan pineapples in history, mostly to Japan.
12. Nancy Pelosi's robinhood app crashes, she flies to Taiwan to check on nvidia stock prices. Result: PRC flies some jets around Taiwan, releases hilariously bad photoshops of PLA boats in Taiwan Strait.

Long and short of it is for the last 20 years, anytime the PRC gets mad, they fly some jets around, and usually a few months later some new cross-strait economics talk happen, or a KMT official is sent to the PRC to do what the KMT do best: drink beer and slap their fat dad bellies with fat dad bellied communists.

I've talked with all sorts here about it. It's, perhaps unsurprisingly, a not-often-discussed issue, because many see it as such a non-issue. From our American Embassy (not an actual embassy) friends, of whom I got to talk to basically all at once at a going away party, the consensus is not only that PRC invasion is all but certainly not happening, if it *were* to happen, the signs would be far stronger, and we'd have plenty of warning. Their perspective is that the USA State Department is quite cynical when it comes to pulling out embassy staff, they usually jump the gun on it, so basically, until we start seeing embassy staff being pulled out of Taiwan, there's not really anything to worry about.

Local Taiwanese are skeptical. Economic relations between Taiwan and the PRC are too strong to justify destroying them utterly with an invasion, which would lead to self-sabotage of Taiwan productivity before the PRC could take over factories, chip manufacturies and the like. From an economic angle, there's just no good reason to do it.
