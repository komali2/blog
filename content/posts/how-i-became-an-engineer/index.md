Some people are in the phase of life that I was in in late 2015 (recruiter, with liberal arts degree, and
a fairly boring future lain before them), and asking how I got from there, to where I am today (full time
employed software engineer, making more money than I ever dreamed of, with a level of freedom in my work
I never thought I'd get).

Me getting asked a question more than once typically results in a blog post.

I'm writing this to illustrate how one can go from a non-degreed CS individual to a full time software
engineer (minus the job search itself, which I cover extensively elsewhere in my blog). I also cover
why you might want to do that.
