Tammy and I went to Taipei, Taiwan this year.

I used to live there so for me it was a return to one of more formative locations of my life.
I've been wanting to show it off for years. I've also been wanting to live out my dream of
motorcycling through the incredible mountain roads in Taiwan.

Furthermore, I'd been on keto for some time, and my hankering for milk tea and small
Asian bakeries was insatiable.

**Itinerary**

* [Pre-Trip Preparation](#preparation)
  * [International Driver's License](#international-dl)
  * [Booking a Motorcycle](#motorcycle-booking)
* [Taipei, Near Tonghua](#tonghua)
* [Taipei, Near Daan](#daan)

## Pre-Trip Preparation <a id="preparation">

### Aquiring an International Driver's License <a id="international-dl">
Renting a motorcycle in Taiwan, at least from the agency we went with, requires an international
driver's license. [AAA](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html) provides this. The important
thing for motorcyclists is getting the license stamped as a "motorcycle license," which when
we did it meant having a stamp on the "A" portions of all the various languages. Note though
that it wasn't good enough to have it stamped in just one, the shop wanted it stamped in *all*
of them. So, when you go to AAA, have them stamp each and every "A" in that little book.

### Booking a motorcycle <a id="motorcycle-booking">
Taiwan is tricky when it comes to foreigners on motorcycles. First off, everyone assumes you
want a white plate (under 120cc) scooter, because they're used to young English teachers that
don't have foreign motorcycle licenses. Then, the law itself is very vague (or maybe it isn't,
and the enforcement is so vague nobody is quite sure what the law actually is), so some shops
are happy to put you on the back of a yellow (>120, <500cc) or red (>500cc) bike, others insist
it's completely illegal.

So, you've got to go to the enthusiasts, and convince them you know wtf you're doing. Luckily I
had an old acquaintance that set us up with #TODO MOTO SHOP on the East side of Taipei. These
guys were legit, and had a HUGE selection of bikes. I went with a Duke 390 and Tammy picked
a Ninja 350. All we had to do was message them on Facebook, choose a bike from their images page
#TODO LINK TO IMAGES, and let them know the dates we wanted it. They requested we give them a
Taiwan address in case we get any tickets, but were cool with the address being a hotel.
Unfortunately, they didn't offer insurance.

Cost was cheap as hell. There was about a $1,600USD deposit on each bike, and then for four days
of rental each bike was about $200USD.

### Taipei, Near Tonghua <a id="tonghua">
We landed at about 5:00am local time, and after and hour bus ride ended up in a very, very empty
Taipei. Couldn't even find a place to get breakfast, so we fastracked to our hotel. Within the first
hour, though, we got to experience some quintessential Taiwan, with a *very* weird movie on display
for us during our bus ride:
#TODO: Insert weird movie

Our first hotel was in my old haunt, near Tonghua nightmarket. Hilariously, it was next door to
Carnegies, by far and away the saddest foreigner bar in the entire country. We dropped our crap off,
changed into some shorts, and rolled out. At this point, it's only about 8:30am.

Luckily we found a breakfast place I was mildly familiar with, it being a go-to before an early
morning hike when I lived in Taiwan. We got our first taste of Taiwan food! Struggled a bit through
the menu and thoroughly confused the wait staff, but ended up with a couple decent enough plates:

From there, it was off to the Tonghua daymarket.

At this point it's about 9am. We're flagging, and the market is overwhelming. You must push your way
through massive crowds of people while hawkers shout at you about fish, vegetables, mushrooms, eggs.
Occasionally, a scooter will squeeze its way through the crowds, miraculously avoiding people's feet.

We pushed through. I was on a mission. I hadn't had a meaningful amount of carbohydrates in months,
part of a keto diet I had been on to allow me to do whatever I wanted when it came to food on this
trip. We needed to find carbs. Specifically, tapioca milk tea, a drink Taiwan had invented that
has taken the world, and my heart, by storm.

So we endured the crowds, hunting for a good enough milk tea place. Nothing is open, though. Still
too early for the shops that cater to Taiwanese of our age.

We staved off death by keto via a little bun from a woman I used to buy breakfast from every morning.

It's deep fried and filled with molten-temperature meat or chives. Next to the lady had been my favorite
custard-pastry guy, but he wasn't in, the cart pushed to the side. I remember he always had worked
whatever hours he felt like.

Finally we came upon a motherlode: a Taiwanese bakery.

Tammy and I loved these things in Japan and always lament that they aren't nearly as popular in the US.
Even if you can find one here, it pales in comparison to the freshness, variety, and obviously cost
that you can get in Asia. Taiwan steps these bakeries up, easily equaling or even surpassing their
Japanese counterparts.

Predictably, we bought out nearly the whole shop, and continued our hunt for boba. We find a 50C near
Tonghua Night Market, dutifully stand in line, my hands sweating at this point, but they're out of
boba! The lady was completely unsympathetic. She had an attitude of "I care not for your suffering,
you're not the first to seek boba from me and fail, begone." Heartbreaking. Tammy got a tea and I
got grumpy. 10am at this point, no boba, I settled in to a sort of bobaless fugue state.

We killed time by wandering towards and around Taipei 101, stopping in parks along the way to snack
on our backpack full of goodies. Particular highlights included seeing the Monkey King wandering
around:

Saw a couple strange things as we wandered around Taipei 101 (with the general goal of finding
the Coldstone Creamery that Tim and I had had spiritual experiences at when I had lived in
Taiwan). First, the Krispy Kreme didn't have a line, which is an absurd blasphemy, considering
that I had never seen it not have a line around the block when they installed it 2014. Also,
outside a closed Nike dealer, an *extremely* long line of the most various ages I'd ever seen.
Half the line was the expected millennial in street clothes, the other was octogenarian or older.
