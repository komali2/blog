Ages ago we hosted a party with the objective of creating a tier list of 7-11 snacks. It's time to finally share the results.

First, if you're just here for the data, [it's all available in the google sheets spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TBq8lrmvhc7AAa1kLKgj-VcJMCXwvgr5VEX_Xlu622Y/edit?usp=sharing).

## Method

We gathered 85 snacks from 7-11 and initially were going to categorize them into sweet, salty, ice cream, drink, etc, but it was proving to add way too much complexity, so we just photographed every item and [chucked them all on a google form](https://forms.gle/YsrZzm1v4QoVatGr8).


{{< figure src="table.jpg" alt="Many of the snacks layed out on the table" caption="This is about half the available snacks. We spent like, 100$ usd at 7-11 lol" >}}

At the party, we made all the food available, as well as some computers with the form open. People would try an item, input their name or some other unique identifier into the form, and submit their score for that item. This way, they could do multiple submissions for various items, rather than try to keep one session open for all items and risk losing their score for other ones.

People could rate snacks a score between 1 (least tasty) to 5 (most tasty).

Yes, taking a picture of every item, then bringing them up to our roof and preparing all the instant noodles and cutting everything into bite sized test pieces was a huge amount of work. My buddy Thomas came in clutch. I'm really not sure how we pulled it off.

## Results

{{< figure src="results.jpg" alt="All of us sitting in my living room" caption="Reviewing the results and eating leftovers." >}}

We didn't collect as much data as I'd have liked. There's 61 different submission events, all having rated various amounts of snacks (some people would rate multiple snacks in one form submit, not the intention but perfectly acceptable). Several items didn't get ratings at all, either because we forgot to put it out or because nobody got a chance to try them.

It's a bit hard to say which snack is the absolute winner. Chicken Wings got an average rating of 5, but only had 1 person review it. Below is some pictures of winners and losers.


{{< figure src="chickenwings.jpg" alt="Bag of Chicken wings from 7-11" caption="Technically chicken wings was the highest rated item, but only one person reviewed them. In my experience they're ok, annoying to eat though as they have bones." >}}
{{< figure src="melona.jpg" alt="Melona bar" caption="An obvious winner is the Melona bar, at 4.83 with 6 ratings. This is an oft-recommended ice cream and a cold snack you can never go wrong with. An absolute must-eat." >}}
{{< figure src="crunchoco.jpg" alt="Crunchoco" caption="Crunchoco are a sort of crunchy chocolaty snack that I really enjoy. This came in high at 4.67 with 6 reviews." >}}
{{< figure src="teaeg.jpg" alt="Tea eggs" caption="Unlike convenience stores in the USA, you can actually trust the hot ready-to-serve food from 7-11 Taiwan. Tea Eggs are a crowd favorite, at 4.60 with 5 reviews." >}}
{{< figure src="grilledbeef.jpg" alt="Grilled beef onigiri" caption="Determining the best onigiri was a big goal of this event. Grilled Beef Onigiri came out on top at 4.50 with 6 reviews." >}}
{{< figure src="matcha.jpg" alt="Matcha ice cream waffle" caption="With Melona bar as a contender, no other 7-11 ice cream could stand a chance, so for fairness I'm including the runner up: Matcha Ice Cream Waffle, with 4.50 at 8 reviews." >}}
{{< figure src="purpleseal.jpg" alt="Purple Seal Instant Noodle" caption="Another big objective was determining the best instant noodle. We didn't get all the options so we'll need to do another event to be sure, but the instant noodle with the Purple Seal was an obvious winner, at 4.11 with 9 reviews - the most eaten dish at the event!" >}}

Now for some losers:

{{< figure src="nougat.jpg" alt="Nougat Bar" caption="We had three variations of the Nougat Bar and they were universally reviled, coming in at 1.33 with 3 ratings for the regular and 76% version, and 1.50 with 2 ratings for the strawberry version." >}}
{{< figure src="creampuff.jpg" alt="Chocolate Cream Puff" caption="I was sad to see this, as I kind of like these, but the Chocolate Cream Puff came in at 2.17 with 6 reviews." >}}
