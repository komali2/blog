I've [written about Emacs before](/posts//my-emacs-environment) because I love
it, and when I started my career it was like a breath of fresh air as a frontend
devleoper surrounded by stack churn. Emacs was something old, well-wrought, used
by millions, completely documented, customizable, ran on everything, and linuxy
when everything else was appley.

I did everything in Emacs up to and including email. I even used Slack in Emacs
for a bit. I was trying to keep hands on keyboard and Emacs made that easy.

The world chipped away at my Emacs world. I had stuck with Spacemacs since it
let me get instantly productive and had sensible defaults. Me as a new engineer
had no idea what kind of keybindings made sense, and with vim and emacs around
for a while, and Spacemacs adopting vim bindings into emacs, I felt I could
trust what the community there was setting. Every once in a while, an update
would break magit, or lsp servers, or even org mode, or everyone would move to
org-roam, and then org-roam-v2, all while I was trying to just do my tickets and
work in an environment that helped me but stayed out of my way.

One too many emails got formatted weirdly in mu4e, or accidentally sent because
I mis-typed, or accidentally deleted, or I didn't see it for whatever reason, so
I moved to Thunderbird. That allowed me a unified way to see all my calendars,
so I moved those to Thunderbird too, solving a key thing missing from
emacs/org-mode: good calendar display.

I loved org-mode and org-roam, and I'd link together all my notes into a wicked
sick knowledge graph, but org-roam was always kinda buggy, the roam buffer that
displays backlinks wouldn't update, pressing enter on links would sometimes just
throw an error rather than fluidly carry me from note to note, and there was
basically no way to browse my knowledge base without a PC with emacs installed
on it in front of me (that happened to be plugged into my syncthing loop). I
tried Orgzly and Orgro, I tried exporting my org files to hugo and then HTML and
deploying it behind a password protected web URL and then tried to script
auto-deployment to it, I even tried auto-conversion to logseq or obsidian and
using those apps to view my notes when on the go. In the end, I had to
acknowledge that org-mode and org-roam for notes was just overwrought and not
good. It probably could be made good, but I could spend all my time doing that,
or I could spend it picking up a new framework or onboarding members to my co-op
or a million other things that were probably more important. So I switched to
Trilium.

A few months ago, I sunk into a deep depressive slump, very unclear of my
identity, not getting anything done outside the bare minimum at work, not clear
what I should be doing with myself once I finished enough tickets to justify my
employment. Should do, want to do, I had no concept of anything really. I
started reading a lot into ADHD (I can recommend "Delivered from Distraction" by
Edward M. Hallowell) and going to therapy. I determined that my TODO list had
gotten insane. Endless tasks saved into org mode, endless want-to-do coding
projects, videos and photos to edit, blog posts to write, trips to one day plan.
All organized quite well, prioritized, split into GTD contexts, and sometimes
even scheduled and having deadlines to narrow scope day to day. Still, lacking
overarching plan, context, desire, and still, endless. I tried a couple
experiments with some AI TODO / calendar management tools, and then with a
VJOURNAL / VTODO / VCALENDAR that leveraged open source and self hosteable
tools, which was very fun and diverting but in the end not very helpful. I
realized that I didn't actually need a very portable way to look at tasks, just
capture them instantly, for later organization, and that the organization I
needed captured priority in a temporal sense - this needs doing by the end of
today, or tomorrow, or this week, or this month, or this year, or sometime in
the next 5 or 10 years maybe. At a given moment, depending on my energy, I could
handle looking at most at a day, but I could count on the day's tasks being well
organized if I regularly reviewed my weekly and monthly tasks and moved them to
where I needed them to go. This insight came from using a physical
day/week/month planner for a bit (Hobonichi Techo) and realizing that I flourish
with graphical, calendar-based representations of tasks and schedules. So, the
one thing missing from org-mode.

// TODO add a picture of a hobonichi week and month page

So, my tasks moved to Trilium as well.

That just left coding. At this point I saw what was happening to Emacs and was
fully open to questioning my dogmatic usage of it all the way. I'd since
migrated off Ubuntu to Manjaro and from Gnome to i3. I didn't really need Emacs
to manage keyboard-first interaction with my OS - the OS itself (and its display
manager) could take care of that. The better I got at using the terminal the
less I needed graphical UIs for file management. So why stick with Emacs? I'd
been struggling to get Spacemacs working with the most modern LSP experience - I
was envious of how well LSPs and suggestions worked in Doom Emacs, let alone
just a bare bones VSCode instance, but I couldn't get either of those to work
holistically well with the bindings I was used to (I still think the Doom folks,
wonderful though most of their work is, are smoking crack when it comes to their
default keybindings - and no Vim plugin in vscode comes close to allowing full
keyboard interaction with every aspect of the IDE even with extensive
customization). Not to mention, the whole world was undergoing an AI assisted
programming revolution, that my friend bullied me into partaking in by trying
out Cursor, and I was hunting for some kind of happy medium between shutting my
brain off and letting the AI write mediocre code, and leveraging AI tools to
code much faster while maintaining quality.

So, to nvim. I'd taken a couple cracks at it before, but never was able to do so
in a way that let me stay productive enough to use it in real world
circumstances while closing tickets at a volume I felt comfortable with. Over
the years, nvim's ecosystem has flourished, culminating in several
well-established plugin managers, and subsequently full IDE packages. The one I
found to be the best fit for me, with the best default keybindings, was
[lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/).

Out of the box, lsp worked, better than Emacs. Several AI platforms worked, such
as Copilot, with built-in chat integration if I want. It came packaged with a
decent git porcelain (lazygit) to finally replace the basically irreplaceably
perfect magit. It had great defaults for full-project grep, file finding, LSP
jump-to-definition and jump-to-type-definition. Also, someone had written a
textbook-sized [manual](https://lazyvim-ambitious-devs.phillips.codes/) about
the thing to supplement the docs (the docs I find a bit lacking, maybe because
of my overall unfamiliarity with nvim).

That's the background. Now the nitty gritty:

## Email

[Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/). Specifically,
thunderbird-beta, which is miles ahead of the main branch in terms of UX and
features. Previously: mu4e.

I plug it into a couple Gmail accounts for work, Migadu for the co-op, and
Bluehost for my personal email. Set up and configuration was dead simple which
was nice coming from mu4e where I had to configure offline-imap and mu to get it
working, as well as maintain some config in my `.spacemacs`. I can even export
my configs to instantly spin up a fully configured suite on a new machine. And,
unlike web-based email clients, I can download my email to manage offline, and
easily back up my emails.

Upsides: HTML emails actually render. A GUI makes it much easier to navigate
folders, search across all accounts, manage archives. Much less buginess around
failed-to-send emails.

Downsides: Microsoft-esque keybindings and not great keyboard-first flow.

I follow a inbox-zero flow and do basically no organization outside of "Inbox"
and "Archive" (and spam). Lately I've been trying to delete as many emails as I
can, such as related to login flows, marketing, calendar event reminders, etc,
because they were cluttering up my search (my oldest email account is 20 years
old). Other than that, I try to assign emails to tasks and then archive them,
zeroing out my inbox any time I look at it. This concept was once captured
beautifully in the "Inbox" app by Google, which Google killed because capitalism
is the best form of economic organization to promote innovation. If you don't
know about inbox-zero, you should read a blog about it and then do it,
especially if you have ADHD like me.

## Calendar

Thunderbird again. I maintain a couple calendars for work, the co-op, and my
personal life (what I need my fiance or personal assistant to see). I self-host
a personal-only calendar for general diary usage or planning time-based tasks
(chores or the like).

Heavy calendar usage is a form of structure that changed my life and is the most
basic and critical tool for me to ensure my competent participation in normal
life. Without it, I'd miss work meetings, doctor's appointments, book fun events
over pre-planned dates with my fiance, hell I'd probably miss flights. Not
because none of those things are important, but because that's the curse of
ADHD. It comes with blessings, and luckily I can manage the curse with structure
and systems.

Here's an example of two weeks from my monthly view:

{{< figure src="calendar.png" alt="Screenshot of 2 weeks from my calendar" caption="" >}}

The color coding is fairly arbitrary and meaningless to me, it just indicates
that the event is saved against a different calendar. I have one for events my
fiance or personal assistant needs to see (such as my mom's birthday or a train
departure time), one for work, one for the co-op (usually onboarding meetings),
and a publicly-facing gmail for events I need to be able to easily share and
live-update (not all that possible with CALDAV because Google and Apple collude
against self hosting). Those green events are me scheduling a busy day out to
make sure I get certain tasks done on time and not overload the day more than is
feasible.

I trust nothing to memory. If it needs to be remembered, it goes on the
calendar. My personal assistant will often put events on my calendar for me
after booking apointments or whatever, so all I need to do in the morning and
throughout the day is take a look and see what I've got to do and when. That
also makes it easy for me to figure out when I will do what - e.g., a 2 hour gap
before a doctor's appointment is a great time to hang at a cafe and bang out a
few tickets.

The flow I'm really wanting to experiment more with is where I try to lay out
events (green in the screenshot) for tasks I want to get done. I tried this with
time-based tasks when I was doing my pure CALDAV experiment, but all the UX's
around that in various client apps are inconsistent. For now I just chuck events
with start / end times. That gives me a good idea what I can get done that day,
or week.

## Computing

### Hardware

I work off two machines. My laptop is a Framework 13 AMD, and my desktop is an
Intel system with an Nvidia GPU. I run a homelab from spare parts and 4 18TB
drives, as well as a NAS with 4 14TB drives. I like the Framework, and recently
upgrade the mainboard and display in it. My desktop has 20TB of storage across a
couple drives, because I like to have my entire steam library installed.

### Operating System

All my machines run some flavor of linux. My laptop and desktop both run
Manjaro, and my homelab runs Ubuntu 24.04. The NAS runes TrueNAS.

I use i3wm on my desktop and sway on my laptop. The desktop, having an nvidia
gpu, has less than stellar Wayland support. I've tried running sway and hyprland
on it, but it was too buggy, so I switched back.

My desktop is also a gaming rig, and I usually launch games from Steam so that I
can leverage Proton. I've used Lutris as well, when some friends wanted to play
WoW. I love being able to just keep the desktop in one OS and not need to
restart it on the weekend to game. It's a bit of a bummer that I can't play some
games with invasive DRM, but, none of my friends really play modern games
anymore, and I only get a few hours a week to do so myself, so it's fine.

### IDE

I now primarily use nvim. In order to get productive as quickly as possible, I
use a pre-built setup called [lazy.vim](https://www.lazyvim.org/). I like this
because I find it easier than other pre-built configs I tried to override the
default configs. Also this guy wrote a great
[usage guide](https://lazyvim-ambitious-devs.phillips.codes/) for it.

I used to use, and love, Emacs. I still love the idea of Emacs, and I'll still
have [conversations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44819424) that make me
want to spend more time learning it and using it, but I found that spending so
much time learning and configuring Emacs was holding me back from learning the
operating system itself. Instead of picking up a keyboard-forward window manager
like i3wm, I was doing everything in Emacs frames. Instead of learning how to
use commandline tools, I was always picking up Emacs packages to accomplish
things. Furthermore, as powerful as org-mode is, I found the actual usage of it
to be counterproductive. I'll discuss this more in the "organization" section,
below.

I always used evil-mode in Emacs, and I got tired of support in other packages
not being great, and always feeling like a second-class citizen because I didn't
use default Emacs bindings. Which, fair, but modal editing feels far superior to
me than default Emacs bindings, and so I feel much more comfortable in nvim
world, where all packages are pre-configured to expect vim bindigns.

I also find nvim LSP support to be more feature-rich and stable. However, emacs
seems to be getting more interesting AI tooling support, so, perhaps I'll try it
again in the futuer!

### AI Tooling

I've tried many AI IDEs and terminal agents, such as Zed, Claude Code, Warp,
Supermaven, Windsurf / Codeium, Cursor, and and Copilot. If there was a plugin
for one of these tools in either nvim or emacs, I've tried both, as well as
native tooling such as with Cursor.

My first usage of Cursor felt like a hit of a good drug, and like that first hit
I'm still chasing the dragon. I realized that Cursor perhaps wasn't the perfect
productivity-add I thought it was when I found myself stumbling to explain code
I kinda-sorta-wrote during a pair programming session, while discovering that
that code kinda sucked. Still, I want to reproduce that sense of incredible
productivity I felt when I first started using Cursor in blissful ignorance.

Unfortunately no tooling comes anywhere near the tab-completion experience of
Cursor. I have found Claude code's agent mode to be fine, and just use git diffs
to check the changes, so I don't really need that built-in experience in
Cursor's agent mode. For AI completions in nvim, I've settled on Copilot, since
it's "good enough" and didn't seem meaningfully different from Supermaven or
Codeium, and our company gets it for free. Lazyvim has some interesting
context-aware Copilot chat plugin, but I don't really know how to use it that
well yet, so I mostly just use Claude code when I want an agent.

### Other Software

Outside of organization software I cover below, I want to mention some software
that makes my life a little better.

On my homelab, I run quite a few services.

[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) is incredible software that basically lets me
host a private Netflix, serving all the legally ripped content on my massive
50TB zfs array for my viewing pleasure wherever I happen to be in the world.

[calibre-web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) allows me to host all my
ebooks for easy downloading to the various ereaders I use, and even has an opds
server available for clients such as koreader to ingest.

[Linkace](https://www.linkace.org/) is my web bookmark manager, I like having a
remote service like this because it works no matter the device I'm on, and feels
more organized than browser bookmarks. I'd tried some other tools, especially
CLI based ones, but they didn't feel as useful. Also, I really like that I can
make publicly shareable lists.

[FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/index.html) is an RSS aggregator that I access
either the webclient for, or use its RSS publication feature to aggregate my
favorite feeds into a single feed I can ingest into whatever client on my phone.
Also, Calibre looks at the RSS output of this app once a week and generates a
"Weekly News" epub file, which I can then download through OPDS to my Kobo and
read the news in a more static way.

[Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) provides a web client as well
as rich mobile apps for listening to my legally downloaded audiobooks. This is a
key part of how I fixed my sleep schedule, I just chuck on a little audiobook on
a 15 minute sleep timer and zonk out.

[Tubearchivist](https://www.tubearchivist.com/) is a Youtube download and
archive tool. I used to use this to help break my youtube addiction since the
only videos I downloaded were from channels I was interested in, saving me from
algo slop designed to maintain my constant engagement. Also, no ads! I switched
to Grayjay since that significantly reduces my harddrive space needs but I still
use Tubearchivist to back up channels I want to archive, such as g0v in Taiwan
or Channel5News. I still have a couple Channel5 videos that were removed from
Youtube because of Tubearchivist.

Various services use [Gotify](https://gotify.net/) to send notifications to my
phone.

[Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) lets me stream my collection of lossless
music to whatever device I want.

[Komga](https://komga.org/) lets me read my comic collection in a web browser.

[Romm](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) lets me serve an excellent web client
for viewing and downloading my legally ripped ROMs, and certain consoles can
even be played in the browser.

## Organization

My organization and personal data management has changed significantly, as has
my whole philosophy, now that I'm off org-mode. I think org-mode is an excellent
and powerful tool, but I think I suffered from the classic ADHD issue of
procrastination-through-optimization. org-mode was more a fun distraction than
an effective organization and knowledge management tool for me. Also, I really
needed a more effective and portable journaling and review system. I'll get into
detail below.

### Journal

The root of my organization system is now
[Trilium](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium) (technically trilium-next).
This is essentially a database based text editing software similar to Notion,
Logseq, or Obsidian. I tried all those tools as well and settled on Trilium
because it's able to be self-hosted, was easy to deploy, has a good web
experience, and of the tools had the best "daily, weekly, monthly, yearly"
journal experience.

Trilium has a button I can click that will instantly take me to "Today's note,"
which it will create, alongside the week and month note for that period if it
doesn't exist yet. Notes are also folders, so I can have my daily journal and
todo list in my daily note, but also nest things under it like meeting notes.
This would be the equivalent of the `org-roam-daily-today` function. There's a
feature unique to the "Journal" notes where Year, Month, Week, and Day notes can
automatically be created from a template. I set the `~dateTemplate=` property of
my Journal note (the root of all year, month, week, day notes) to point to my
"Day Template" note, which looks like this:

```
## Review

1. All habits done that can be?
2. Tomorrow planned?
3. Satisfaction level?
4. Any ugh?
5. What energized me?
6. What gave me joy?
7. When did I feel most myself today?
8. What bored or drained me, and why?
9. I felt most absorbed when…
10. I felt slightly playful when…
11. This made my brain light up:

## Plan

1. Habits allocated time?

## Journal

## Todos

```

I had a major depressive episode like 4 months ago and read a bunch of books
about ADHD about it, as well as talking with a therapist and Mr. ChatGPTherapy.
Not an app, I just dumped my journals into ChatGPT and asked for advice. These
questions are the result of that. The point is, every day I check in on what I
actually like doing and what gives or takes away energy from me. I'm also
hunting down what activities naturally engage my ADHD hyperfocus and are worth
pursuing for deeper learning. I discovered I really enjoy drumming this way. If
this is surprising to you that someone doesn't know what they like doing or
might like to do, you're lucky! I'm not. The key passage from "Delivered from
Distraction" by Edward M. Hallowell is:

> The connected individual-of any age- naturally feels safe and secure enough to
> go to step 2 in the cycle, which is play. By play, I mean something deeply and
> profoundly formative - any activity in which you become imaginatively
> involved. The opposite of play is doing exactly what you are told.

> When you play, your brain lights up. This is where you could find joy for the
> rest of your life, so take note when it happens… When you play, you are likely
> to enter a state… named “flow.” In “flow,” you become one with what you are
> doing… Your brain glows.

> The more activities you try, the more likely you are to find one where your
> imagination kicks in and you play… Once you find some activity in which you
> can play, you want to do it over and over again. This is called practice,
> which is step 3. Practice that emerged out of play is practice you want to do.
> You don't have to be hounded to do it; you want to do it. Here is where habits
> of discipline develop that will last you a lifetime.

> As you practice, you naturally achieve mastery, which is step 4. By mastery I
> do not mean that you are the best, just that you are getting better. This
> feeling of making progress is the key to self-esteem and confidence, as well
> as motivation. …

> As you gain mastery, other people notice and value what you're doing. This is
> step 5, recognition.

So, that's become the main goal of my daily journaling to track. I still keep an
"engineer's log" in the "Journal" section of the note just because it feels
kinda cool and has sometimes been useful, such as when I recently searched
`useradd` to find the onboarding flow for new users to our co-op's VPS.

Furthermore, I keep a daily written journal in a
[Hobonichi Techo Cousin](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/), the larger sized
version. Next year I'll use the smaller sized original version. In here I'll
focus more on emotions and vibes, and leverage the magic of handwriting as a
sort of meditative exercise. I can't really read my own handwriting so this has
very little review potential. It still feels good to slowly be creating a
real-life artifact of my year. Although of course I have the archivist obsession
with digitization, and value the ability to search digital notes, more and more
I'm moving back to analog in specific areas. I also fill out in green pen what I
got up to across the day in the Weekly Agenda portion of the Hobonichi. I'll
discuss more in the [Calendar](#calendar) section.

On Sunday or Monday, I do a weekly review. It looks like this:

```markdown
## Plan

1. Tammy time on calendar?
2. Friend time on calendar?
3. 1 known energy gain on calendar?
4. Any major events need further planning?

## Big TODOs

## Review

1. Satisfaction level?
2. Goal progress?
3. What made me feel “ugh”, or, bored or drained me?
4. What energized me?
5. What brought genuine joy?
6. What activities consistently felt like “play?”
7. When did I experience “Flow?” When did I feel absorbed?
8. When did I feel most myself?
9. What activities did I naturally seek out?
10. What made my brain light up?
11. Major accomplishments?
```

At the end of the month, I do a monthly review. It looks like this:

```markdown
## Month Overview

1. Does your month have friend hangouts?
2. Family hangouts?
3. Tammy dates?
4. A motorcycle ride?
5. Any major events need further planning?

## Big TODOs

## Review

1. What stood out?
2. What brought genuine joy?
3. What activities consistently felt like “play?”
4. What energized me?
5. When did I experience “Flow?”
6. Satisfaction level?
7. When did I feel most myself?
8. What bored or drained me, and why?
9. What surprised me this month?
10. What activities did I naturally seek out?
11. Did anything I explore make me curious?
12. What habits felt enjoyable or supportive?
13. Which habits am I doing out of obligation?
14. Major accomplishments?
15. Focuses for next month?
16. Which small experiments genuinely improved my mood or confidence this month?
17. Where did I unnecessarily push myself too hard? What can I release next
    month?
18. Did I speak kindly to myself this month? When did I struggle most with
19. self-compassion?
20. What tiny victories can I celebrate this month (especially regarding
    Mandarin,
21. weight loss, or exercise)?
22. What feels truly sustainable going forward (diet, exercise, language,
    emotional health)?
```

### Task Management

I used to use org-mode to manage my tasks, and had it all set up with GTD tags
and contexts, custom super-agenda views I could invoke with muscle-memory
keystrokes, had custom org-capture templates, the whole shebang. It worked fine.
I thought I didn't like how it wasn't very portable, even though apps like
Orgzly exist, but then I tried an experiment with CALDAV vTODO entries on a self
hosted calendar and using Tasker with Davx5 syncing to have a really great task
experience between my phone and desktop. Then it turned out that portability
wasn't the missing link, it was the fact that my TODO list was functionally
infinitely long, and despite having prioritization, didn't have a good way of
setting temporal priority.

I experimented with SCHEDULED and DEADLINE properties in org mode and in the
agenda view, but what getting a Hobonichi physical planner made me realize is
that what I really wanted was a way to see my tasks and needs laid out upon a
calendar. org-mode just doesn't really have a good way to do this, at best you
can get agendas, which must be invoked any time you want to see them, and they
can only be for a day.

I wanted a way to say, "I have 7 big things I want or need to get done this
month, I want to schedule them such that they 2 will get done in the first week,
3 the second, etc. And I want to be able to see day to day which days are busier
or not and easily slot tasks in during planning phase." I also wanted a way to
plan far ahead, put something like "you need to have the plane tickets for Japan
Burn purchased by this month." Having `#[A]` next to tasks plus context plus
deadlines wasn't getting me there.

So, I sacrificed the ability to generate on-the-fly agendas and quickly move
around TODOs for a digital experience very similar to my physical diary, where
tasks have to be manually moved around with copy - paste operations and
basically manually laid out.

#### Year, Month, Week, Day TODOs

In practice, here's what that looks like. Trilium has my "dailies" laid out like
this:

```text
- 2025
---- January
--------Week 1
------------ 2025-01-01
------------ 2025-01-02
---- February
```

In the 2025 note I'll put all my big ambitions for the year:

```markdown
## Big ambitions

- Learn Rust
- Add review feature to OSMAnd
- Improve drumming
```

As well as have a spot for "floating" todos, that are granular tasks that I can
just go ahead and do, but I don't really care when they got done, or, they got
moved here from a momnth/week/day (more on that below).

```markdown
## Floaters

- Get Taiwanese IDP
- Get guitar amp
```

When a month starts, or is about to start, I take a look at my ambitions and
floaters, consider the remainder of my year, my calendar (any trips that month?
Any big work projects?), and any TODOs that are time-constrained to that month
(e.g. trip planning), and then try to fit in floaters or smaller slices of a big
ambition into the TODOs for that month.

Here's what a month looks like:

```markdown
## TODOs

- edit photos for 2025.8.12
- glue sandals
- get appointment with nutritionist
- get some work done on rust project
```

Once a month is "planned," I take a look at the TODOs for the month, and start
breaking them out across the weeks. This would be, in my hobonichi, the part
that looks like this:

TODO: HObonichi week picture

So, I would create Monday day notes for each week of the month, which
automatically creates week notes. Then, in the week TODO, I'll assign a couple
monthly tasks/ambitions, again taking into consideration my calendar and
anything that's already on that week's TODO (again e.g. if there's trip planning
or something that needs to happen then).

Here's a week's todo:

```markdown
## TODO

- Edit photos for 2025.8.12
- glue sandals
```

Notice that those TODOs are cut and paste straight from the month TODO. I remove
it from the month list when I assign it to a week, to keep things uncluttered
and so that when I look at the month list, I know it's things that haven't been
assigned yet, which either means they need to be assigned, or, are just floaters
waiting for me to have free time to do them whenever.

The pattern continues. On Sunday or Monday, I break my week tasks out across
days. Again, I've got my calendar open when I do this. I might have a nice big
empty coworking day where I want to put tasks that'll take a lot of time, and
put smaller tasks on days I have a couple appointments or whatever. Or,
something will need to have feedback from someone else before I can do the next
step, so I schedule that for a Monday or Tuesday.

Here's a daily todo:

```markdown
## TODO

- glue sandals
- rw-1330 fix experiment button
- confirm date time with tammy
```

Again, when I move something from week to day, I cut and paste it.

The critical step that makes this all work is my "waterfall" that I do at the
end of a day, week, month, and year.

#### TODO Waterfall

At the end of every day (or start of the next day), I review that day. I do the
same every week, month, and year. This review is half a self-learning activity
(see [journaling](#journal) above), and half task management, or perhaps
"project management".

So, at the end of the day, consider the above daily TODOs. I've finished
confirming my date time with Tammy, but I didn't glue my sandals, and I didn't
finish working on the `rw-1330` ticket for my job. I did work on the ticket, but
I don't care to track that in my TODO system (I used to use org's clocking
feature to track this kind of thing, but then realized that outside of client
projects, this was useless information).

Depending on the priority of the task, and the layout of the remainder of my
week, I'll simply cut and paste those remaining tasks to the next day, or some
other day of the week, or, if it doesn't matter if the task gets done that week,
or if I can't do the task this week because I'm blocked, I'll just bump it up
back to the week TODO list. Then, I'll check the week TODO list to see if
there's anything of priority there that needs to be moved into the next day or
some other day, and if there's too much in that week, I'll cut out some of the
week tasks and move them into the month list.

I'll do the same at the end / start of every week and month, and thus my task
lists are constantly kept mostly up to date with priority established in a
temporal sense. At least once a week I'm going to have taken a peek at any
floaters hanging around in the month or year tasks, and the super time-sensitive
stuff will already be scheduled in some future week or month, so I just don't
need to worry about them.

You might think that's time consuming. My daily review usually takes about 10
minutes at most, including task review. Week review and planning usually takes
about half an hour, and monthly usually takes about an hour. The year process is
much more time consuming: including the Year Compass, this usually takes many
hours spread out over a couple days. However, I consider it critically important
in terms of ensuring I actually do shit during a year, and continue
self-improvement.

What's important to me is that so far, this is the most organized and effective
I've ever been, or felt, and I've had external feedback from work, my partner,
my co-op members, and my friends verifying this.

#### New TODOs

If something pops up randomly in a day that I need to note as a TODO, it's
critically important that I can record it instantly with no friction. I have two
ways of doing that: if I just have my phone on me, I create a VTODO entry using
the jtx Tasks app on android, which saves to a self-hosted caldav server. Then,
as part of my daily review, I view my VTODO list in Thunderbird and move these
TODOs to a given day, week, month, or year list.

The other way I record these is my current experiment, detailed below.

#### Small Notebook Daily TODO List

Based on a random Hackernews comment that I can't find anymore, I'm trying out
carrying around a small spiral notepad. Every morning I start on a fresh page,
write the day and date on the top, write "Start daily list," cross out "Start
daily list," and then write anything that immediately comes to mind that I need
to get done. This helps me clear my head out in the morning right away. If I
have something on my Trilium list that's not on my pad, or vice versa, I copy
from one to the other.

This helps me better internalize what I need to get done that day, helps center
me in the date (I often will, during this process, think something like "wow
it's already the 20th, I should make sure to lock in on xyz task," or "summer's
almost over, I need to go to the beach this weekend!"), and is kinda fun for
whatever reason.

Also, it's nice to always have a notepad on me, because then I can stamp it in
the metro, which is a fun little colorful way to see what days I was out and
about. Also, I'm back to thinking hand-written notes is superior to all other
methods, so I can take down notes at the doctor's office or whatever on my
notepad. I switch to the back side of the notepad rather than use the TODO page
for notes. Then I copy notes that need to be remembered, into Trilium.

At the end of the day, I check the page to see if there's anything critical left
on it, get that info into Trilium if necessary, and then rip that page out and
put it in a glass jar I have on my desk. This is fun too.

I find this process much more feasible and fast than the thermal printer thing
that everyone is kinda obsessed with right now.

### Notes

I used to take notes in org-mode and use org-roam to link them all, following
[Zettelkestan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). After 7 years of
this, I didn't find these linked notes to be any more useful than just a
full-project string search, and furthermore, it was time consuming, and finally,
the graph-view thing was only ever useful to show off at a coworking meetup.

I also determined that I was taking way too verbose notes. I would hand-write my
notes and then copy them verbatim to my system. I wanted to digitize EVERYTHING!

So, over the years I tried many experiments in trying to find ways to markup
what I'm reading - annotating PDFs in emacs or similar, or, using an e-reader
that has a tablet note-taking function (Boox, Remarkable), or using tablets with
pens such as the Surface Pro or Ipad. 8 years of experimentation has led me to
determine that pen and paper remains the most effective, dependable, and
rapidly-deployable note taking method. I can make it more fun by using fountain
pens, but day to day I use Pilot FriXion erasable 4-color pens, which I love
because they come in 5mm variations which let me have very neat and tidy notes,
and having multiple colors is great for letting me have rich markup in my notes.
All the electronic methods suffered from dependability issues and were too slow
to deploy. With a small notebook (I prefer the soft-spiral Kokuyo notebooks) I
can whip it out and be taking notes within seconds, no fiddling needed.

For notes in pdfs and epubs, I use a Kobo Clara BW. I discovered that more
important than any rich notetaking functionality was the ability to have my
e-reader on me at all times, and the Kobo Clara BW is small enough to fit in my
back pocket. I just use the highlight functionality, and then copy my notes to
Trilium when I finish reading.

In Trilium, I have `Reading` note, where I nest all the books and articles I
read in their own note. I have some "promoted" attributes that I use for basic
data like URL, author, and start/end dates, but I haven't done much with those
yet. Under a given note, I nest a `Highlights` note where I copy in any direct
quotes from the book I want to retain.

The most important change from my org-roam days is that I try to type out far
fewer notes about an article or book. I narrow down the highlights to only the
most important ones, and I note down only the really stand-out thoughts about a
book. I don't note down any kind of summary, or bullet-pointed article
breakdown. I just note down a couple things that were useful or interesting to
me, and move on. This way, each of my article and book notes are actually useful
to me, rather than just the equivalent of a Wikipedia article on the thing. When
I was deep in Zettelkestan world, I kept coming back to the thought that I was
basically re-writing Wikipedia, and I didn't understand the point of that when I
could just go read Wikipedia instead. Cynical maybe, and I'm sure there's
Zettelkestan fans out there yelling right now about how my notes always should
have been very brief little notecards, but just like with my TODO strategy, I
needed to have more friction to make that happen.
