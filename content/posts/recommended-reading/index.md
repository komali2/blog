It's time for my to arrogantly plop all my favorite (or at least, recommended) readings into
a webpage so I can just forward this to people asking for suggestions.

I think the best way to do this is to organize lists by topic, and have duplicated links
to longer descriptions of a given reading and why I like it. So for example, Cryptonomicon
will find itself listed both under "Must Reads" and "Great Scifi," though both links
will link to the same paragraph or so of my thoughts on it. That means that the best way
to go through this article will probably be by following links. If you find this
horrible and frustrating and have the energy to send me an email telling me so, I would
be enormously grateful. My email address is caleb at this domain.

# Walkaway
## Cory Doctorow

Topics: open source / libre (code, designs, etc), copyright / copyleft, post-scarcity,
3d printing, cryptography, energy and renewables, communism, anarchy, medicine, bio-hacking,
post-humanism and transhumanism, futurism, transportation, philosophy of mind

"Walkaway" is kind of like "what if Burning Man, but always?" The conflict is between
the bourgeoisie and the prolet - er, sorry, between "Default," that is, normal,
State-enforced, capitalist society, and the Walkaways, that is, the people who simply
walked into the barren wasteland abandoned by Default as nonproductive, and tried to make a life for themselves.

The topics list is so long because Cory Doctorow covers just about every topic imaginable,
somehow managing to keep the narrative moving while answering all the "but what if" questions
you can think of regarding an anarcho-communist society, such as, "what if guys with guns show
up?" or "what if you break your arm?" or "what if capitalist society sees your movement as a threat
to enforced scarcity and wages war on you?"

I included it under my "must reads" because it's a very realistic, yet entertaining, portrayal
of how close our society is to post-scarcity (if we're not already there), and what the possibilities
are for us if we let go of profit motive.


# How to Win Friends and Influence People
## Dale Carnegie

Topics: empathy, making friends, having conversations

The self help book upon which most others are based. If you only ever read just one of those
sorts of books, I suggest this one. Dale Carnegie was giving talks on the subject of
effectively interacting with other people for years before sitting down and writing this
book, which allegedly in the course of doing so had him reading hundreds of biographies,
speeches, and other sources that recorded effective communicators. Basically, back in
the 1920s when he wrote this, he put in all of the work so nobody else would
ever really have to.

The title smacks of snake oil self help, but the book itself focuses on empathy and good listening
as ways to "win" people over. There's none of that weird salesman sociopathy. Carnegie's ethics
appear sound. Anyway, I recommend it not only because it helped me learn best to communicate, but also
helped me learn better to empathize with other people's position.

# Cryptonomicon
## Neal Stephenson
