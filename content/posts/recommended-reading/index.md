It's time for my to arrogantly plop all my favorite (or at least, recommended) readings into
a webpage so I can just forward this to people asking for suggestions.

I think the best way to do this is to organize lists by topic, and have duplicated links
to longer descriptions of a given reading and why I like it. So for example, Cryptonomicon
will find itself listed both under "Must Reads" and "Great Scifi," though both links
will link to the same paragraph or so of my thoughts on it. That means that the best way
to go through this article will probably be by following links. If you find this
horrible and frustrating and have the energy to send me an email telling me so, I would
be enormously grateful. My email address is caleb at this domain.
