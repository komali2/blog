I hate when I can't find pricing for shit.

I was doing some research into how my tax situation is going to work in Taiwan, and came across a relatively  useful
website, https://onlinetaxman.com . Expect a blog post on the results of all that research some day.

In any case, they don't have their prices listed anywhere, so I had to go through the process of giving them
my email and scheduling a consultation.

For a consultation, they charge $39 USD. They say:

"Should you decide to retain Online Taxman for your tax preparation,
the $39 fee for the initial consultation will be credited to your first bill."

If I go with them and more fees start coming in, I'll update this post.
