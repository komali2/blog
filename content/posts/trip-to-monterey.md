Over president's day weekend, Tammy and I were fiending for a trip. We initially thought about doing a short-notice LA jaunt, but
put that to another weekend, when we could actually convince some people to come with.

So: [Monterey, California.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey,_California) Made famous by, news to me, John Steinbeck, who
apparently was really into sardines. Also, apparently Monterey once had a booming sardine industry - hence Cannery row. All news
to me - I just knew it had a dank aquarium and was a hotspot for whale watcher.

The itinerary:

* Check out Aquarium
* Do a Kayak Tour

Aaaand that's it. Pretty simple, straightforward. We had been talking around the end of last year, beginning of this, about how
we should take the time to explore California before we potentially leave it (forever?), and, why over complicate things? Anyway,
just two things turned out to be plenty, as Cannery row and walking around town more than filled space.
