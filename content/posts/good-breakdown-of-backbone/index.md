At <a href="https://electricimp.com/">Electric Imp</a> we use a <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> / <a href="http://marionettejs.com/">Marionette</a> stack, so when I'm not churning through bugs I do what I can to learn the frameworks. I found this great tutorial that demonstrates not only how to use Backbone, but also the best way to use it - <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/wiki/Backbone%2C-The-Primer">The Backbone Primer</a>. Slowly but surely I'll try to implement a simple app mirroring our stack at this <a href="https://github.com/komali2/backboneBasic">simple Backbone project repo</a>.
