To celebrate Tammy's birthday, more than a year ago we booked a Viking cruise from Athens to Rome. I'm not normally a cruise guy, but turns out, floating in a hot tub that's floating in the Aegean Sea is lit. This is the onebag report on the trip.

Details are 9 days total, with several days on either end of the cruise where we're staying in either Athens or Rome and just walking around all day. It's November, so a chilly Meditteranean Autumn, temperatures between 9 and 19 degrees celcsius. It never really rained, luckily. Activities would include a lot of hiking around, but also nice dinners on the boat that had a moderate dress code, so I had to balance these two clothing needs. And, unfortunately, I had to work a bit while on the trip, so needed my laptop.

I was running some experiments with where and how I pack stuff in my bag, plus some new equipment, as well as leaving behind stuff I had brought on EVERY trip (OPZ, lockpick). I'll get into it. First, the inevitable:

{{< img src="fromleft" alt="Everything in my onebag spread out on the bed in Athens, from the side, left.">}}

{{< img src="fromright" alt="Everything in my onebag spread out on the bed in Athens, from the side, right.">}}

Lots this time.

Here's the list as it exists in Google Keep. I keep a "root" packing list in Keep, and when it's time to pack for a given trip, I duplicate the list, then modify and add specificty to the duplicate as needed. I pin it and give it a pretty background picture or something to stand out. When I pack before the trip, I check everything off, touching each thing before I put it in the bag (some kind of mental trick well documented by a million youtube videos about how Japanese and NYC train conductors point at stuff**. I then repeat this process when packing at a hotel or whatever, to make sure I don't leave anything behind. Saved my ass many times!

It's a pretty big blog of a list, I'll go into more detail in sections below. Note that they're separated into thematic categories, whereas below I'll be separating them into the subsection of the bag they go into so the categories may differ.

## By Section

### Clothes

{{< img src="clothesunpacked" alt="The packed clothes for my trip.">}}

Normally the ultralight, uber-modular version of me has the say on a packlist, and I almost always travel with white leather sneakers unless I'll be motorcycling. If I need a jacket, I always pack a down-filled Uniqlo thing. I try to keep somewhat presentable, but I definitely look someone that's wearing packable clothes. For this trip, I knew it'd be cold basically always, and that I'd not have shorts (thus boots would always be ok), so I opted for clothes at least a bit more stylish.

You've heard it a thousand times: layers. The strategy day to day for me was chino pants (which dress up better than jeans), ubiquitious uniqlo airism undershirt (decreases long term stinkiness of outer layers and washes and dries within a few hours), some kind of casual tshirt, a long sleeved button down of some kind (thick linen and flannel are the two options I brought), and a stiff cotton jacket that I look dashing in. Earth tones, baby. Cap it off with inch thick fat boi Redwings and I'm proper ready to stomp around three thousand year old ruins.

The fits worked great for everything the trip threw at me. I stripped down to the tshirt layer only once, when hiking up some [absurd hill](https://goo.gl/maps/fqEDv31eg4eDASmV8) in Athens. The rest of the time the full kit kept me the perfect temperature. Even on the plane, I was able to use various layers to tuck in for lumbar support or whatever. Meanwhile, my packed clothes fit into a single compression bag and took up very little space in my bag.

The boots were great for getting compliments from various hucksters, salesmen, and scammers, but also worked a treat for the 20 kilometer days we were pulling at the start and finish of the trip. They were a bit of a downside on the boat when I was slipping in and out of the room a lot, especially when I wanted to throw the robe on and head to the spa, or work out in the gym. I wondered if I'd regret not packing the usual Xero sandals, and I kinda do. I managed to borrow a set of changing room sandals on the boat and that solved it, but one takeaway for me on this trip is that the sandals are basically always useful. They take up very little space.

The hat I picked up before a hike to Yushan and never used. It was a godsend in our trip to Mexico so I'm loathe to take it off the packlist yet. Tammy ended up using it a lot, which is kinda how it goes with the hat: usually a girl steals it.

Socks are some generics I picked up from Uniqlo fresh before the trip and destroyed in the course of it.

Gloves are some nice leather ones my mom got me ages ago. Gloves are a weirdly necessary thing for me, my fingers just get ever so cold, and they make it a lot easier to do a quick bike or scooter rental when I'm traveling.

### Electronics

{{< img src="goodiesunpacked" alt="My electronics for the trip, set on the bed.">}}

{{< img src="techunpacked" alt="More of my electronics from the trip.">}}

It's silly in hindsight but something I was really looking forward to when thinking about the trip throughout the year was kicking it on the sundeck playing on my brand spankin new Steam Deck. I ended up finding much more interesting things to do on the boat, of course, and in the end didn't pack the Deck. Which is a shame, because I love the thing, but it really is hard to justify dragging its huge ass case around. Packed, it'd be the bulkiest item in my bag, and nearly the heaviest. I'm thinking about ways I could replace my laptop with it, maybe with an external screen or something but... nothing beats the convenience of pulling a laptop out of a bag, opening it, and getting to work. Oh well, project for future.

Laptop is a Thinkpad T14 AMD version dual booted with Window (basically never used) and Ubuntu probably 22.04. I find the battery can usually make it through a good 6 hours. I've of course considered getting an M1 mac but I can't justify diving into a closed ecosystem like that, especially because I loved buying the base version of the T14 and then installing upgraded components myself. Just can't do it. Also OSX sucks. Anyway, work I do is generic software engineering, so that's what the laptop was for. It was also great for being a dumping ground for my camera SD card, transferred via the usbc hub, after which I'd throw any good enough JPEGs in the camera in Google Photos, and upload the rest of the RAWs onto Google Drive just in case the whole bag drops into the ocean or something.

New kit for the electronics is a GAN charger from [Spigen](https://www.spigen.com/collections/gan-charger/products/spigen-arcdock-120w-desktop-charger?variant=40469127069743). It's their 120w version, which I went with because I wanted just one fatass charger that I can plug all of mine and Tammy's shit into. Of particular interest to me was the fact that the main power cable is detachable and of a universal format (some ankers had a detachable cable but I couldn't tell the format), which is great. More electronics should be designed that way. Helps reduce waste. If the power cable, the most frequently stressed part of the device, breaks, the rest of the thing is still fine.  Anyway the charger is way heavier and blocker than I expected, but it was great to have, fast charging my phone and laptop at the same time, or charging decently fast a laptop and two phones, or whatever other combination of stuff we could plug in. PLUS, said universal external power cable is also compatible with my camera battery charger, which ALSO features a detachable cable, letting me cut down on a cable (now if only my camera charged via usbc...). See, this is why you design electronics like this! The external cable also made it easy to plug into fiddly airplane power outlets. I've had problems with integrated plugs being too heavy and pulling themselves out of those, or not having room because of neighboring chargers. Not so when your plug is just a small simple cable!

Further new kit is the blue Tom Bihn case in the second pic above. I wanted that as my "plane bag," full of whatever I needed to keep myself sane on a 12 hour waking flight. Into that went my Kobo H20, anker power brick and requisit usb cables, hand sanitizer and wipes (cause yall nasty), earplugs, earbuds, usbc to aux audio converter (my greatest shame), eye mask, phone stand, and a Gamesir x2 bluetooth controller phone dock thing.

The GAN charger, cables, universal power converter, usbc dock, hdmi cable, and camera charger went into the orange Tom Binh "Snakecharmer" in the first pic, above.

The phone stand, usbc dock, controller, and hdmi cable combined to make my phone into a dope little media station on the plane and in the hotel room. I've got a Samsung Galaxy ZFold 3, an absurd purchase justifiable only because I got a discount for signing up on a phone plan I was gonna get anyway. Folding phones are great but the cost is just way too high. But since I have it, Imma use the thing. It's phenomenal for gaming, I can easily emulate NES through Gamecube and PS2 on it, at higher native resolutions even. It's also fantastic for DS and 3DS, especially combined with the stylus, so basically the few times I was gaming I was playing Elite Beat Agents. Combined with the Gamesir makes my phone into a handheld or docked emulation beast. At the hotel I could throw my phone into Samsung DEX mode and use it as a music or video player, though on this trip that only made sense for some jazz on the one day we had to stay in a bit to work. The phone and stylus were also great for written journaling, my preferred form, and that lets me cut the regular notebook + fountain pen from my kit (I do miss the pen though, writing ballpoint on postcards just isn't as fun).

The Kobo has Koreader running on it, which I highly recommend. Customize your shit, proprietary software sucks. Books are downloaded to it via an OPDS server I run at home. The server is also running Readarr, grabbing books I want as I add them and then updating the calibre server. Great flow.

The weird headbad thing to the left of my passort in the first pic is a generic bluetooth speaker headband. Once you start with one of these combined with Headspace sleepcasts (or similar) you can't go back. I sleep like a baby now. Useless on a plane though.

For regular audio, sitting on top of my laptop is a set of Galaxy Buds Pro 2. They have active noice cancelling, which is now a requirement for me to have a good flight. Also good for quick calls or whatever. Horrible for lag when trying to game, though, or doodle some music on my phone, hence earbuds and aux cable.

To the left of my gloves and above my sunglasses is a Fenix I believe E18, with a USB rechargeable battery inside. I hate carrying random proprietary cables like the magnetic chargers that some flashlights want, so I swapped the battery the light came with. Phenomenal light to have that has saved my ass with the strobe in dangerous road situations before. The lowest light mode is perfect for not causing an incident on a dark plane by switching on a small sun when I'm trying to dig for something. Under my gloves is a small generic bicycle light with various red and white modes that I experimented bringing with this trip. Now, it's a must have, basically always. It easily clips onto my camera strap, backpack strap, belt, collar, wherever, and can give me nightvision-saving bright red light or decently luminous white when I really need to see. Used it constantly on the trip on poorly lit walks, in pitch black bnb stairwells, and as a strobe when scootering around Rome. I could conceivably use it as a non-directional white light for photos if I wanted, but never bothered.

Camera was my pride and joy on this trip. It's a Fujifilm XE-2 that I picked up for something absurd like $150USD a few years back. Apparently they're becoming popular again as everyone wants to get their hands on an xtrans-2 sensor, or are looking for a Fuji as carryable as the x100v but actually available to buy. Normally people pair it with some kind of reasonable pancake lens, since it's a somewhat older camera that won't be taking the absolute bleeding edge pictures, but just before the trip I grabbed an insane f1.4 18 that's just about as long as the camera is wide. No regrets, the lens turned my small mirrorless into a beast, a totally different camera, I couldn't believe the pictures I was getting on the trip. I'm still editing them, but a lot of the JPEGS came out just fine (I shoot in RAW and JPEG simutaneously, exposing down for RAW) hopefully I remember to add some good ones to the bottom of the post. Somewhere buried in the pile is a sd card to usb converter, and there's one in the usbc dock as well. My laptop has a microsd slot but no sd slot unfortunately, so dongle time. Also with the camera are some peak straps as well as a peak "leash" I think they call it, just like, a wrist strap thing. I regret not bringing the peak design "clip" or whatever, would have been good for backpack + camera days. All to save just a few grams of weight... gotta draw the line somewhere, I guess.
