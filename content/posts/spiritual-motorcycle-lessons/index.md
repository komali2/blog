* [Patience](#patience)
* [Ego Control](#ego)


## Confidence <a id="confidence">

This one kinda goes without saying, but riding made me more confident. If you
can handle getting on the back of a bike, what can't you handle? The whole
process will give you more confidence in yourself. You'll see that you can
learn to do a very difficult and scary thing. You'll prove to yourself that
you're capable of setting yourself apart.
