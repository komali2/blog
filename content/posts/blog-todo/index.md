After messing around with all sorts of blog solutions, from my early college days playing around with Blogger (see [Ablate](http://www.ablate.blogspot.com), [Taipei Tips](http://taipeitips.blogspot.com/), and [Taiwan Hikes](http://taiwanhikes.blogspot.com/)), Wordpress (see [Komali Stories](https://komalistories.wordpress.com/), free cringe!) and a botched attempt to roll my own in Vue with some sort of node convert-.md-to-html libraries, Hugo seems a happy bet.

It did take me a good couple days to sort though and I'm still not entirely sure what I'm doing when I mess around with it (I need [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54028912/in-hugo-documentation-what-is-meant-by-%E2%8A%A2-%E2%8A%A3-and-similar) to help me parse Hugo documentation), so I'm running a little to-do list at this page to track what's next for this currently MVP blog.

# Todo
* Figure out how to have category lists show a tag lists filtered by posts in that category with those tags
* Figure out how to get _partials to work for categories, tags, and posts pages
* Find a way to combine category.html and tag.html
* Auto-deploy on git push
* Limit tags list to top tags
* Create page to view all tags (after doing above)
* Find good way to display tags and category on a blog post
