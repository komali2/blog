ZSA, the company that built my daily driver split keyboard, the [Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/), interviewed me and featured me on their [ people page ](https://people.zsa.io/caleb-rogers/)!

It was really fun to get a state-of-my gear post together as well as a snapshot of everything I was doing at the time, late least year 2023. I think it'll be fun to go back and read that in a few years! I wonder if I'll still be using the same keyboard...

BTW I should do a blog post about this but, split keyboards are the superior way to enter text into computers, and if you value your back longevity as an engineer, I highly recommend making the jump. You don't have to get a weird orthilinear keyboard like the Moonlander, there's "normal" split keyboards as well. Just so long as you can spread your hands to be shoulder width apart, that's all that matters.
