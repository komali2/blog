I've [argued before](/posts/why-taiwan/) that Taiwan is a great place to be a digital nomad, and in some ways this is just an extension of that post, but a spate of recent travel has made me feel even more strongly about the subject: I'm now convinced that Taiwan is plain and simply the best place on Earth to live.

Normally I'd hedge this argument with a lot of "ifs." If you're a moneyed foreigner, if you're a software engineer or someone else that can work remote, if you don't need fifteen acres of empty space around you to be happy, THEN Taiwan is the best place to live. But my hedges are starting to sound hollow as I travel around the world again and see the state of things elsewhere. I mean, it's worth bearing in mind that the person reading this IS a moneyed software engineer that can work remote for USA jobs at USA rates, that certainly makes my life in Taiwan phenomenal, but really that just makes my life anywhere phenomenal compared to locals. That's just the nature of privilege, and if I step back from that lense and consider locales on their own merits alone, rather than through the lense of my higher-than-average levels of freedom and privilege, it still sits at first place.

This article is prompted from a recent trip through Europe for Tammy's birthday. I got to see a lot of countries, a lot of cities. I got to meet a lot of other travelers (we were on a cruise - did I mention privilege?), mostly well-off Americans and Brits, and had some conversations that indicated to me that the highest qualities of life probably can't be found in empires anymore.

I haven't lived everywhere, but if we only opined about these kinds of things if we had maximum possible experience, nothing would ever get written. If you're living somewhere better, email me, let's talk about it. I'm not trying to debate whether one country is better than another because of pride or anything, rather I think the comparative and assertive nature of my proposition (that Taiwan #1) is a good framework to let me lay out an argument for why people should come check it out, and what kind of things are really unecessarily bad in wherever they're living. Taiwan exists as a place that merges a lot of really fantastic things that people all around the world should be demanding of their societies and governments.

On that note, mostly what I'm about to talk about is things humans can actually affect. If you like snow and hate heat above 35 degrees celcius, Taiwan just isn't for you, and nobody can do anything about that. It's a kind of nature-of-the-universe thing that seems pointless to discuss in this context. So, I won't.

So what does Taiwan have, that other places don't, that people in those places should point to Taiwan and say, "why do they get that and we don't? We should build that here.**

# Healthcare

## Healthcare Access

Socialized healthcare. Universal healthcare. Plenty of places have this, but for those that don't, such as the United States, there's simply no excuse for not having it. Sociopathic conservative arguments for why money takes precedence over human life should simply be named and shamed for what it is: capitalistic death cultism. If you can spend your citizens' money on jets, you can spend it on hospitals.

In Taiwan, all citizens and residents get a single-payer health insurance number that lets them pay dramatically reduced rates on basically all sorts of non-elective healthcare. A great example is when a friend of mine had to go to the emergency room for something stuck in their throat. ER visit, xray, one physician taking a look and then recommending a visit to the gastroenterologist, said gastroenterologist doing an endoscopy, all taking about an hour and a half and costing around $20 USD. This, at around 11pm. Anyone wanna guess how much that would have cost in the USA, with insurance? How about without? Without insurance in Taiwan, I'd peg it at no more than $100 USD, because the nature of single payer means that in general healthcare costs are driven down, even for the uninsured.

The hospitals are clean and relatively fast, and the health outcomes are *better than in the USA* for many illnesses. The average age is higher, after all.

Americans should take note: your healthcare "economy" is a tragic joke. I saw a great tweet the other day, related to the world cup: it's impossible for Americans to engage in banter, because no matter what they say, all you have to reply is "go pay your deductible mate** and they lose. Fix your shit, you are being cucked by health insurance companies.

## COVID Response

Related to healthcare is emergency management. Name a country that balanced quality of life against economy and health outcomes for COVID better than Taiwan. America killed a million of its citizens because its radically conservative-tilted Overton window meant that people were allowed to argue with a straight face that Bill Gates was injecting nanobots into your blood with the vaccine without being laughed out of the public sphere. The American president famously opined about bleach as an effective COVID treatment, and a few weeks later so many Americans started eating tubes of horse medicine that stores around the country started running out and had to lock the shit up in the pharmacy. That is clown world behavior.

Meanwhile most other countries in the world made pathological grants to the whims of economists and traded "economic needs" against human lives, resulting in thumb-twiddling and mixed messaging to the public around whether bars and restaurants should be open, whether masks should be worn, what it means to social distance, and whether businesses should or are allowed to require vaccination before entry. Again looking at you, Brits. It was simple as outdoor dining, putting your pub tables outside, and requiring masks on transit. That alone would have saved untold hundreds of thousands of lives around the world. While other countries deliberated, Taiwan made it simple: control the borders at the beginning of the pandemic, a simple masks-on-if-not-at-home bright-line rule, and enforced social distancing.

Some hardcore leftists might accuse me of minimizing the PRC's hardcore zero-covid response. Some would say the rabid authoritarian response was the best. Shit, one can't deny the PRC certainly had pretty decent covid results, but at the cost of predictably burning a couple people alive in a locked down apartment. Worth it? Probably not. Low COVID numbers was simple for those that kept it simple. The PRC made it... weird.

Anyway, I'm assuming COVID-19 isn't going to be the last pandemic in my lifetime. Americans kicked and screamed every second they had to wear a mask: here in Taiwan, it was already relatively normal to wear a mask, particularly when you're sick, you know, so as to help not get others sick. Hindsight, what a remarkably simple societal norm. I can't believe when I was growing up in the USA we'd just be ok with people coughing basically all over eachother, or, in many of the cultures I've worked, lauded people who come sick into work. Disgusting, and let's put on our capitalist hat for a second: what a great way to get a little bit more reduced productivity out of one worker only to sacrifice the productivity of an entire office a week later. It's just irrational from every angle.

So if COVID 2 hits, and Americans or whoever (Turks, in my travels, seemed to hate it too) whine and cry about simple shit like wearing a mask, Taiwanese will simply re-adopt in greater numbers the norm, and will again have lower rates of spread, lower rates of infection, a flatter curve that reduces hospitalization peaks, and just in general be more adult about the whole thing. I wanna be here if that comes about, not getting coughed on by sheep for whom the greatest philosophical expression of independence and counter-culturalism they can strive for is being an irrational dick on purpose.

## General Health

Do the old people in your country spend every morning and evening walking five minutes from their house to the local park, no matter where in town they live? Do people in your country have access within five minutes by walking to publicly-provided exercise equipment, in every neighborhood, that's open unrestricted 24/7? Does your country have public gyms with socialized costs and extensive equipment and classes sprinkled throughout your city? In your country, who really decides pollution policy: big oil politicians at the leash of Chevron lobbyists, or NGOs and public interest politicians in an actual democracy that answers to the demands of the people?

This was striking to me on my recent trip: Americans seem *really* unwell. This could of course be because a cruise type vacation selects for people who have various age-related disabilities and want to see the world in a way thats easier on their body.
