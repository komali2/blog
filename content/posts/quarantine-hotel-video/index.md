I published a short video showing off my setup during my two week
quarantine in Taiwan. Expect another post going more into detail
about what that was like and how I kept sane.

The video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GerD1Mxw40).

The transcript is copied in the raw below, for those that don't want
to use Youtube or watch a video.

1
01:00:02,533 --> 01:00:03,617
Good morning!

2
01:00:04,884 --> 01:00:07,884
I am going to give a little tour

3
01:00:10,467 --> 01:00:13,467
of my quarantine hotel, the day before I leave.

4
01:00:14,033 --> 01:00:15,850
Or, actually, I'm leaving today...

5
01:00:16,283 --> 01:00:17,016
So

6
01:00:17,016 --> 01:00:19,133
kinda messy right now, cause I'm still packing, but

7
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,133
got this little entrance here, where I keep my water

8
01:00:23,316 --> 01:00:25,133
sometimes they give me little snacks and stuff

9
01:00:25,133 --> 01:00:26,850
I don't really, like

10
01:00:27,233 --> 01:00:29,233
... instant noodles, I don't really eat that.

11
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:31,350
This is also where my luggage goes, when I'm not packing it
up.

12
01:00:31,867 --> 01:00:34,550
cause there's not really a closet here, or anything

13
01:00:34,984 --> 01:00:36,817
This is a little shelf.

14
01:00:36,817 --> 01:00:38,684
I had, like, a white light my parents gave me

15
01:00:38,684 --> 01:00:41,684
to help make me feel, like, less depressed. You know? Cause
I'm inside

16
01:00:41,817 --> 01:00:42,867
This is my desk.

17
01:00:42,867 --> 01:00:44,934
I ended up getting this monitor.

18
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,533
4k monitor

19
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:50,033
I ordered it at 9am and it showed up at 2.

20
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:52,900
I had gone a week, just working on my laptop

21
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,050
I was like, "I don't need it."

22
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,200
I definitely needed it.

23
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,617
Got my MIDI setup.

24
01:00:56,617 --> 01:00:57,967
Make some mUsIc

25
01:00:58,183 --> 01:00:59,417
Split keyboard

26
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:01,050
It's all tucked...

27
01:01:01,817 --> 01:01:04,116
My laptop's tucked there, on top of the fridge.

28
01:01:04,116 --> 01:01:05,000
Surge protector...

29
01:01:05,116 --> 01:01:06,417
Hard drive...

30
01:01:06,817 --> 01:01:10,016
It's actually not too bad. I really miss having a standing
desk, but...

31
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,934
it worked. I mean I was basically sitting there like

32
01:01:12,383 --> 01:01:13,850
10, 12 hours a day.

33
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:16,850
Bed. I had to push this bed up against the wall.

34
01:01:17,016 --> 01:01:18,884
So I could have space to work out.

35
01:01:19,367 --> 01:01:21,417
Didn't end up working out that much. Just a lil bit.

36
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:23,266
Had this TV, it was ok.

37
01:01:23,567 --> 01:01:25,033
Remote doesn't work.

38
01:01:25,033 --> 01:01:25,650
So

39
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:28,033
I was trying to make an arduino, like a universal remote.

40
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,050
The view out this window... I REALLY like having this giant
window here.

41
01:01:31,183 --> 01:01:32,517
I never saw my neighbors.

42
01:01:32,617 --> 01:01:34,734
Which is probably good cause I was like, naked half the
time.

43
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:35,650
but

44
01:01:37,316 --> 01:01:38,717
get this window open

45
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:43,367
Can kinda see some buildings over there.

46
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:45,717
Oh, it's really warm out today.

47
01:01:45,717 --> 01:01:46,233
Ugh.

48
01:01:46,233 --> 01:01:48,517
When I first got here, it was freezing cold.

49
01:01:48,934 --> 01:01:50,950
I got these blinds, that I can close

50
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:51,383
at night

51
01:01:51,383 --> 01:01:54,066
so that people don't see my naked ass walking around.

52
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,450
and here's the bathroom

53
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:58,717
which, I actually ended up paying more to have the tub

54
01:01:58,717 --> 01:02:00,300
which ended up being super nice

55
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,300
cause I love

56
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,133
the tub.

57
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:03,033
And here's my

58
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,483
million dollar view

59
01:02:05,183 --> 01:02:06,283
very nice

60
01:02:06,283 --> 01:02:07,633
in the morning and night

61
01:02:07,633 --> 01:02:09,033
especially can see the

62
01:02:09,033 --> 01:02:12,033
sky turn the color of the sunset and the sunrise

63
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:14,800
So sometimes I just sit here on this little balcony and like

64
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,900
study, or whatever.

65
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,817
Just try to look at stuff far away

66
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:19,767
cause I'm looking at screens all day.

67
01:02:19,884 --> 01:02:21,233
Shower's not bad either!

68
01:02:21,633 --> 01:02:23,767
It's like, all glass, and stuff...

69
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,350
Back when it wasn't too hot

70
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:28,216
I had all these windows open all the time

71
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:29,900
AND

72
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,350
bidet

73
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:33,867
godsend

74
01:02:34,066 --> 01:02:35,817
Yea, so

75
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:37,083
That's my little setup

76
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:39,066
That's how I've been sitting for the last two weeks

77
01:02:39,283 --> 01:02:40,817
and now I'm about to go

78
01:02:41,066 --> 01:02:43,784
start the new phase of my life :)
