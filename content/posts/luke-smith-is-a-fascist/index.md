Wait what?

Edit: I didn't believed he was a fascist and a bigot. Now, I'm doing my research, and it becomes apparent when you dig into his primarily non-linux videos. He's models himself on the unabomber. If I can directly tell him one thing, don't use violence against those that you think are your enemy; it's not worth it.

He's a white supremacist and an ecofascist. Near the end of his video title "Keep Politics out of Technology!" t. Boomer, he brings up supremacist dog whistles, like: - [ being replaced by his enemies ](https://youtu.be/3NJIj47Tusw?t=650) - using white-male discrimination claim in tech. - [ Recites the first line of the unabomber's manifesto from memory ](https://youtu.be/3NJIj47Tusw?t=116) who was an ecofascist who quit his university to live a primitive life in the woods (similar to Smith himself).

Like to point out that he also says in the video, - Blames SJWs for taking over linux. - Luke also spouting about how degeneracy is caused by technology. - The irony, he's argues against politicizing technology by politicizing technology. - Says everything is political.

Evidence for being fascist:

This [ whole video about Joseph Schumpeter book, but the videos is actually pro-fascism without calling it by name ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYUgTzT79ww&list=PL-p5XmQHB_JQTeUxtGBI7sHCOOuY4qT-B&index=10). He does this by addressing the economy and social decorum separately. Put them together and you got yourself what's eerily similar to fascism without a leader (yet has been caught sharing a pro-Trump wallpaper on Github). - "Capitalism reduces inequality." BULLSHIT! - Claiming author is a "Black-pill conservative": DDG search gave me this [ recent definition ](http://www.amerika.org/politics/introduction-to-the-black-pill/) from a "furthest right" blog post with some dehumanizing points: "Nothing 'means' anything.", "There is no morality.", "There is no truth.", "Good intentions produce bad results.", "The Black Pill denies humanity." - "Hostile Elites" Calling anyone left of center an elitist. (he hates on the word in other videos) - He 'read' half the book and was only fixated on telling you about the "collapse capitalism because of democratic socialism" part and not the part where the economy will eventually resemble socialist "utopia". - Says the author is being 'ironic', despite the book being revered by economists and higher education.

Definitely radicalized: - [ Rationalizes being gay is against Logos ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktNWD8XyCeo&list=PL-p5XmQHB_JQTeUxtGBI7sHCOOuY4qT-B&index=1&t=428s), AKA Jesus. - Pro [ Alex Jones ](https://lukesmith.xyz/blog/alex-jones-increasingly-based-now-even-more-banned-from-everything) - He reads their article since Jones' was banned from Twitter - [ Roads should be abolished ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geBQNOid_7A&t=16s)! an ecofascist rant with references to the unabomber. - [ Hating on SWJs because he can't debate them ](https://youtu.be/3NJIj47Tusw?t=665).

Question: - Has he mention specifically why he left higher education other than his "freedom" being reduced? - What has he done for the last two years?
