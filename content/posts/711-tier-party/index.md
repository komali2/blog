We wanted to know what snacks from 7-Eleven are the best snacks. In case you didn't know,
7-Eleven (which I will call 7/11 for the rest of this post)
is a convenience store chain in Asia. If you're American and you're thinking that kinda
grungy gas-station type place you get slushies from, it's sort of that, but, different
company. Some sort of Asian conglomerate bought the rights for everywhere in Asia and
turned 7/11 into a god-tier convenience store. Similar shops are Hi-Life and Family Mart
in Taiwan, or Lawson in Japan.

Anyway, these places are ubiquitous and usually open 24/7. They are chock full of all kinds
of random food: Rice balls, dumplings, instant noodles, boiled eggs from a vat of tea, chips
in every possible variety, candies, breads, ice cream, honestly everything. It's overwhelming.

So, with the application of "crowd sourcing" and "statistics" (translation: bribing people with alcohol,
and calculating using hillbilly math), we figured we could figure out, definitively, what the
best food 7/11 has on offer.

# The Process

To get something out of the way: this won't be good science. We chose the snacks totally at random
based on what kinda looked good, from one 7/11 near our house. Not everything was represented.

In the days leading up, I thought about building out a little fullstack app to allow uploading
snacks, submitting scores, and then tracking those scores. I made the repository for this app
and then immediately afterwards abandoned this idea in favor of a Google Form that feeds into
a Google Sheet.

The day of the party, about two hours before, Tammy and I went to a 7/11 near our house, and
just started filling baskets. What little plan we had built up in the weeks beforehand vanished
in the face of the cold reality of just how much food there is at 7/11.
