This March I attended a g0v hackathon. g0v holds these hackathons every 2 months to give the entire
g0v community a chance to regularly meet, as well as to allow newbies, such as me, an opportunity
to get introduced to g0v and find ways to contribute.

[g0v](https://g0v.tw/) is a civic community here in Taiwan, founded by Digital Minister Audrey Tang.
The community is a mechanism to act on the value system Audrey Tang is implementing into the government.
This value system is shared with many people here in Taiwan as well as internationally, and so there are
a great many volunteers working to improve Taiwan through g0v. Concepts such as Open Source / Libre,
radical transparency, sustainability, and equity are all ideals that are being promoted through g0v.

I had a really wonderful time at the hackathon, and it further cemented for me that moving to
Taiwan was a fantastic idea, and that I should stay here for as long as I possibly can.

## The Projects

This hacakthon wasn't a competition type one, with prizes at the end. Instead, it was a place where
long-term projects recruited new members, and new projects were pitched. It was very similar to the
regular Code for San Francisco meetups I had been to in the past, where groups worked on various
open source projects to improve their city, country, or world.

In the lead-up to the hackathon there had been some discussion on the g0v slack of working on improving
the gold card application website as a hackathon project, but I'm glad that fell through, as coming
with no project and really no expectations seemed to be the best possible thing. My Mandarin speaking
ability isn't great right now, so I went in with a plan to simply lend my engineering abilities wherever
I could to help however I could.

Luckily, g0v is practiced at accommodation. At the entrance was a booth to sign in. After signing in,
I was given a name tag and pointed to a box full of stickers that I could use to identify my skillset
as well as what type of topics I was interested in. The skill set stickers included things like Python,
Javascript, React, Full Stack, Vue, Android, Photography, and Data Science. The interests stickers included topics such as Environmentalism,
Intellectual Property, Nuclear, and Radio. I grabbed Environment, Full Stack, CSS, HTML, Javascript, React,
and Python, and then simply wandered around.

Almost straightaway someone introduced themselves to me that recognized me from my slack profile picture.
They chatted with me a bit about what was happening and what to expect, and let me know that projects
