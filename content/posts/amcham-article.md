The [Taiwan Gold Card](https://goldcard.nat.gov.tw/en/) office sent out a survey to all Gold Card holders, asking about their experience so far in Taiwan, what brought them here, that kind of thing. After the results came out, Amcham Taiwan, the American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan, wrote [an article](https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2021/08/foreigners-give-taiwan-high-marks/) looking at the results of the survey. In preparation for that article, I was interviewed! That was very fun, but the best part is how extensively I was quoted throughout the article. My favorite quote:

> “The intention and the spirit of the government and the locals is to be welcoming to foreigners,” says Rogers, the American engineer. “So while that doesn’t necessarily always get implemented, when you do interact with the person here who is involved with your acclimation into Taiwan, it is a positive experience almost 100% of the time.”

I'm no longer a simple software engineer, I am The American Engineer :)
