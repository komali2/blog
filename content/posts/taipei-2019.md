Tammy and I went to Taipei, Taiwan this year.

I used to live there so for me it was a return to one of more formative locations of my life.
I've been wanting to show it off for years. I've also been wanting to live out my dream of
motorcycling through the incredible mountain roads in Taiwan.

Furthermore, I'd been on keto for some time, and my hankering for milk tea and small
Asian bakeries was insatiable.

## Pre-Trip Preparation <a id="preparation">

### Aquiring an International Driver's License <a id="international-dl">
Renting a motorcycle in Japan, at least from the agency we went with, requires an international
driver's license. [AAA](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html) provides this. The important
thing for motorcyclists is getting the license stamped as a "motorcycle license," which when
we did it meant having a stamp on the "A" portions of all the various languages. Note though
that it wasn't good enough to have it stamped in just one, the shop wanted it stamped in *all*
of them. So, when you go to AAA, have them stamp each and every "A" in that little book.

### Booking a motorcycle <a id="motorcycle-booking">
Taiwan is tricky when it comes to foreigners on motorcycles. First off, everyone assumes you
want a white plate (under 120cc) scooter, because they're used to young English teachers that
don't have foreign motorcycle licenses. Then, the law itself is very vague (or maybe it isn't,
and the enforcement is so vague nobody is quite sure what the law actually is), so some shops
are happy to put you on the back of a yellow (>120, <500cc) or red (>500cc) bike, others insist
it's completely illegal.

So, you've got to go to the enthusiasts, and convince them you know wtf you're doing. Luckily I
had an old acquaintance that set us up with #TODO MOTO SHOP on the East side of Taipei. These
guys were legit, and had a HUGE selection of bikes. I went with a Duke 390 and Tammy picked
a Ninja 350. All we had to do was message them on Facebook, choose a bike from their images page
#TODO LINK TO IMAGES, and let them know the dates we wanted it. They requested we give them a
Taiwan address in case we get any tickets, but were cool with the address being a hotel.
Unfortunately, they didn't offer insurance.
