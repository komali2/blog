In late January and early February of 2023, my family visited Tammy and I in Taiwan. It's something I never really thought possible but always wanted. When I think about My Family, I automatically put myself back into the "normal" mode, the kind of thinking where moving to a foreign country or going to a coding bootcamp isn't like, a thing that people do. Yet I always argue that these sorts of things are much more accessible or even easy than people think, and lo and behold, having my family visiting us in Taiwan held to this argument.

My family doesn't really have the kind of travel experience I have. They're not totally isolated typical Americans or anything, but this would be their first trip to Asia, and also one of the biggest sort of "adventure** trips, rather than traveling for a relaxing vacation on a beach somewhere, so it was for many reasons going to be a very unique experience for them.

I have two reasons to put this blog post together: first, to record and reflect on the experience, and have on the web a sort of scrapbook of what we did and how much fun we had, that any of us can look at or share at any time. Second, I wanted to share as much of what we did and how we did it as possible, to enable other people to take similar trips, or perhaps convince others that trips like this are very much in the realm of Things That People Do.

# Planning

## The Spreadsheet

Planning a trip can be an overwhelming task, but as has been preached for overwhelming tasks, the solution is to break it down into manageable pieces. A spreadsheet helps with that. I've been making spreadsheets for trips for over a decade now. To some it can seem like overkill, but even for the simplest trip it's nice to have one spot for all your airbnb links, plane ticket times, a basic schedule, etc. If you're traveling with more than just yourself, the collaborative ability that comes with a shared doc (not necessarily a spreadsheet) is worth the energy alone if nothing else so you can answer every question with "did you check the spreadsheet?"

We set up a [family planning doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u-sqizprBxZsFJGmUctvabLTNjKJlaTgVWRBOE5j2ps/edit?usp=sharing) months before the trip. This way, the family could see what kind of activities we were cooking up, and suggest which ones they were more excited about, which let us prioritize our planning.

In short, it has a tab for important info, such as emergency numbers (which are different than in the USA!), the address, map links, and webites of our airbnb and personal apartment, both in English and in Mandarin, theory being at least they could just show that to a taxi driver if anyone got lost. There was also Tammy and my phone numbers.

This came in handy in unexpected ways, such as at the border when they needed to provide contact information for locals, or write down the address of their accomodations.

Another tab was the "ambitions" tab, which looked like:

| ambitions / activities | est % of day | grade of WANT | inside / out | explanation | lead time | link etc |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| stationary store to get notepads | 5% | A | inside | big paper store, pens, fun | 0 | |
| daan park walk | 20% | A | outside | central park of taiwan, birds | 0 | |

We filled it out over the weeks any time we thought of something it could be cool to do with the family. As we did so, my family started adjusting "degree of WANT" scores and we got a better idea of what kind of trip my family wanted to do. It was a little hard because it would be their first trip like this, and they also had no idea of what to expect or what was possible, so we added "lead time" and length estimations and whether an activity was inside or out to help everyone have a better idea of what could happen when.

A more casual version of this tab was the "food bucket list" and "caleb and tammy's favorite restaurants etc" where people basically just dumped cool things they knew about or had heard of. The food bucket list in particular was useful because we could refer to it when we were out and about and be like "oh wait we're actually right next to a famous guabao place right now, let's go." So, while some might think a doc / spreadsheet / schedule is a really restrictive thing, actually it enabled us to be really flexible and nimble.

These tabs fed into a "Schedule" tab that I highly recommend for most trips. For this trip ours looked something like this:

| | morning 6-12 |  afternoon 12-6 | night 6p-6a |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Sun 29 | | | |
| | 6 parents land| 12 songshan cultural creative eslite | our house + richard |
| | 6-9 airbnb | 13:50-15:30 glassblowing | raohe night market + riverside |

It looks better on the actual spreadsheet. Point is, notice we were able to mix hard-scheduled things, such as when my parents land (and Tammy and I needed to be at the airport by) or the booked glassblowing glass at 13:50, with more flexible activities, such as being at raohe night market.

We continually tweaked this as we got closer to the trip, and it let us know what was really possible to accomplish in the trip. It fed back into the ambitions tab and let the whole family adjust their expectations. For example, Kenting was desired, but we determined it would basically nuke an entire day, and thus we nixxed it in favor of doing other stuff.

We mostly planned out the first halfish of the trip, with only vague notions of the second half, so that when the family arrived and we had down time, we could plop more blocks of activities for later days. This combination of documented planning and flexibility worked honestly better than I've ever seen trip planning work. It was good to know what was going to be going on the next day, so we could chill out and store our energy if needed, make sure to get to bed on time if necessary, or know that we can comfortably stay out late without issue. It prevented nasty surprises for people who decided to stay up too late just to vibe, and also prevented a typical annoyance I have with trips, where activities are lost because everyone got out the door too late.

A flexible but recorded schedule also let us create a really balanced trip, where we could put really hardcore days against more chilled out ones, to prevent burnout. Plus, combined with keeping a sharp eye on the weather, prevented regret if we woke up to find a rainy day on the day we wanted to go ride bicycles or whatever.

The trip spreadsheet went so well I'm essentially now an obnoxious evangealist for the concept.


## Packing One Bag

Another new thing my family would be trying was [onebag travel](/tags/onebag). I've been preaching about this for ages as something basically anyone can do, despite as earlier mentioned always have this weird feeling of normality, like, is that really something My Normal Ass Family can do? Turns out yeah, it was their first onebag trip and they did really well. They all rolled in with Patagonias holding the majority of their stuff. Of course, in my opinion they were overpacked, especially my Dad, who was carrying around this like fifty pound monstrosity, but that's par for course for a first onebag trip.

Anyway, those considering a trip like this should strongly encourage all participants to investigate and try out onebagging. My family got off the plane, breezed through immigration and customs, and were exiting the airport onto the train in about thirty minutes. Then, we were able to take the Taoyuan express train and transfer to the MRT and have a nice easy ride on trains all the way to our Airbnb because nobody had a massive roller luggage to deal with. It's a game changer.

Also, throughout the trip, everyone was game theorying their packs, talking about what they didn't need to have brought, talking about packing strategies, and planning on what they'd do differently next time. It's just another fun thing really.


## Accomodation

We went with an Airbnb so we could all stay together in the same place. We also initially thought my family would want to stay mostly keto, and thus we'd need to be cooking a lot, and so would need a kitchen. The Airbnb was a good idea because it was really nice to hang out as a family like we do on most trip. I did discover that within Taipei and on the MRT, it's really hard to find a good Airbnb, even at high pricepoints. If you look outside the city you can find some incredible places for really cheap, but in Taipei itself the newer places are too tiny for a family, and the older places are just plain ugly and often gross looking (and plagued with issues like drain smell or bad plumbing).

We stayed at [this airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/673741797107840347?) near Nanjing Sanming station. It was perfect, being right next to the MRT station, as well as in quick bicycling distance of our own apartment, so if anybody ever got overwhelmed they could always flee to the peace of the apartment.

In past trips to Taiwan, Tammy had booked some really cool hotels. Hotel choices in Taipei are in my experience more interesting and luxurious than Airbnbs, so for those that don't need one big space for the whole family, I'd recommend looking into that. Outside Taipei though, give Airbnb (or just googling for BnBs) a shot.

## Misc Needs

### Train Cards

We wanted to almost always take public transit on this trip, to show off how awesome the public transit system in Taiwan but also because of all the reasons that public transit is just superior to driving anyway: more relaxing, everyone can hang out and have a conversation, not too cramped, and in Taipei at least, it's often faster to take the train. We also wanted to be able to take U-bikes, which are honestly an incredible solution to the last mile problem and I love showing it off.

So, before my parents came, we picked up a couple random yoyo cards from 7-11 or somewhere. Tammy added them to her account to make sure they worked with ubikes, although, we aren't sure that was necessary.

For those coming that don't have people here to do this prep work, you can pick up a yoyo card from vendors in the airport, and I highly recommend that as the first activity so you can use it right away on the Taoyuan express MRT to Taipei.

### SIM Cards

We were planning on getting cheap prepaid sim cards for my family so they could make calls in an emergency or if they get lost or whatever, but also just use their phone data as they please without worrying about huge roaming charges. Plans were foiled when we were given another reason why USA is a clown world country when my family pointed out that their phones are "locked," which means that even though they paid full prices for the small computers, they aren't actually allowed to *use* the small computers. They may use them as AT&T pleases and dictates. That is of course normal and acceptable.

So, SIM card plan out, and anyway our carriers wanted us to show a passport to get prepaid sims which was stupid and annoying. In the end we hit up one of the wifi box vendors in the airport arrivals hall and got an unlimited wifi box for like 1000ntd a week or cheaper. Can't exactly remember, but it was cheap and got the job done, everyone connected to that wifi when they were out and about.

You could of course look into unlocking your phone, and if you for some insane reason find yourself in possesion with a locked phone that you paid money for, you should absolutely do so immediately.

### Money

Taiwan is a cash heavy country. You can get away with only using a foreign credit card, but it'll be painful and annoying, and you'll miss out on a lot of activities, such as the night market. If you're down to only eat at 7-11 (not Family Mart! They don't take foreign credit cards), you can do it.

So, you need cash. You can always just withdraw at an ATM and eat a small fee of usually around 3$ USD. I set up a Charles Schwab account ages ago that refunds ATM fees and has no transfer fees, so, I just dumped a shitload of cash into that, then my family venmo'd me however much  money they wanted to spend. In the leadup to the trip, I withdrew a bunch of cash, and paid for a bunch of stuff when they were here. Worked great.


### Scooter Rental

We had the ambitious idea of taking the entire family on a scooter trip from Taipei east through Shifen, Huotong, finishing in Jiufen, and then back. I have a motorcycle, and our neighbor lent us his scooter, so we needed just one more scooter to finish off the ensemble.


I've done [a whole post on renting motorcycles in Taiwan](posts/rent-motorcycle-taiwan) that I recommend reading for details. In short, get your IDP before you come, make a reservation at a rental spot ahead of time, and you're good to go. It's a bit harder now with the place I recommed because they want a local guarantor, but that's more for heavier motorcycles. You can always look into more traditional rental agencies for just a scooter.

There's no reason to rent a car here. Don't bother, just take trains. You'll absolutely ruin your trip wasting time to find parking and stressing about driving in the dense roads here. If you are somewhere remote like Hualien, just hire a cab for the day, it'll cost probably around 2-3k TWD.
