Before we get started, my goal here is to consolidate the answers I've gotten to questions I've been asking, and the research I've been doing, and touch that a bit with my own musings I've been doing over the last year and change. I hope that people that read this consider that it's been written by a very comfortable straight white dude with moderate Mandarin skills and native English skills living in Taiwan on a cushy unrestricted visa. After reading this article, it would be a very good idea to not draw too many strong conclusions from it, but instead maybe use it to formulate your own questions you go out and ask other people, Taiwanese or otherwise, and hopefully not also straight, white, American, and male.
