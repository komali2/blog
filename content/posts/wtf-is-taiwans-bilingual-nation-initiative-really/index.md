Before we get started, my goal here is to consolidate the answers I've gotten to questions I've been asking, and the research I've been doing, and touch that a bit with my own musings I've been doing over the last year and change. I hope that people that read this consider that it's been written by a very comfortable straight white dude with moderate Mandarin skills and native English skills living in Taiwan on a cushy unrestricted visa. After reading this article, it would be a very good idea to not draw too many strong conclusions from it, but instead maybe use it to formulate your own questions you go out and ask other people, Taiwanese or otherwise, and hopefully not also straight, white, American, and male.

I wanted to make that clear cause I'm going to make some sweeping generalizations here and I really don't have enough perspective for people to just take these generalizations without a grain of salt. 

So to start: In late 2018, Taiwan's Executive Yuan approved a blueprint by the National Development Council (Gold Card visa holders know this council well) with the goal of "developing Taiwan into a bilingual nation by 2030."

It's a common topic, usually to make fun of: Hah, make Taiwan bilingual, by 2030? How's it going to teach EVERYONE English in just 11 years? 

Stop there, this is why I have my big disclaimer at the top: most people make a lot of assumptions about this topic, and to have a good conversation here, we need to address those assumptions.

Most people hear about the Bilingual Nation initiative kinda vaguely, like there's some Act or Law or Decree, and it's called Bilingual Nation, and I guess the goal is to make everyone Bilingual? Sounds hard. It's probably a good idea to talk more about the actual legal instrument of "The Blueprint" and what that means the government is /  will be / is allowed to do, and we will get to that, but first, the assumptions:

Why do people assume the intention is to make everyone able to speak English? On top of that, why do people assume the other half of the binary is Mandarin?

Alessandar Ferrer of Kyushu University in Japan and Tzu-Bin Lin of National Taiwan Normal University in Taiwan wrote an excellent article exploring these demographic, lingustic, identity type issues in a paper on the subject titled ["Official bilingualism in a multilingual nation: a study of the 2030 bilingual nation policy in Taiwan"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01434632.2021.1909054?journalCode=rmmm20) that I highly recommend. Full text PDFs can be found by googling the title. 

Taiwan has seven "national languages," affirmed by a combination of the Indigenous Languages Development Act as well as the National Language Development Law, those languages being [Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Mandarin), [Hokkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien), [Hakka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Hakka), [Formosan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formosan_languages), [Matsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsu_dialect), [Wuqiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putian_dialect), and [Taiwan Sign Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Sign_Language)
