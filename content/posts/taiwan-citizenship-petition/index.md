Taiwan has a requirement for one of its citizenship paths wherein you must renunciate your original citizenship. This is not something many of us interested in Taiwanese citizenship are willing to do. Therefore, I made a psuedo-petition with a simple question: would you seek Taiwanese citizenship if you didn't have to renunciate your original citizenship?

It's not a real petition because I'm not seeking to change policy: signing doesn't mean you're saying  "Taiwan should change this policy," it merely indicates that, should the policy not be the way it is, you'd seek citizenship. I had no plans to send it to the government or anything like that, just make the petition itself available as a resource for those interested in talking to people about the issue.

I released the petition as a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/3/d/1AS-Z4YYM3IuDh25jKJoQdxC_6-KqgmJKVE3M703gMxA/edit?usp=drive_web) a few months back, and it's time to take a look at results. If you're just finding this now, feel free to fill out the form, and I'll update this post accordingly.

I had several categories of questions based on the level of anonymity people were seeking, so not all information about everyone will be made available.

## Results

17 people responded to the survey. 12 people were willing to have their name publicly listed on the petition:

A further 5 people were comfortable with their names being shared with the Taiwanese government only.

### Length of Stay in Taiwan

14 people responded with how long they've stayed in Taiwan.

* 14.3% (2) have stayed less than 1 year
