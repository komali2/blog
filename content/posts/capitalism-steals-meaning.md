 Has capitalism weaponized desire to be a part of something greater, to be working together on a great goal? :@laptop:
Outside of a company, what do we have like that? With clear vision? Stonehenge?
pCapitalism takes away from your ability or chance to be bored and think about your true meaning

It steals your meaning

In [Stonehenge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101086.Stonehenge), Bernard Cromwell tells a fictionalized tale of how the massive stones were raised 4,000 years ago, so far as we know it before the invention of the wheel for that culture. The TLDR in the story is it took some 10 to 20 years and thousands of effort-hours from hundreds of people, to the purpose of uniting humans with gods. The instigator was a mad priest with a singular vision, and others participated only because he was able to convince them of his vision.

Lately I've been wondering what mad singular visions we've been missing as a species due to the fact that most people spend 40 hours a week (at least) staring at someone else's computer screen. I've been wondering what visions have been pitched and why people work on someone's vision these days, and it made me think of people our society raises up as our modern visionaries: Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg.

It makes me feel like we've lost something. Steve Jobs wants an iPhone and the energies of something like 30,000 people was directed to the effort. Result is we get an iPhone, which is cool and all, but was that the dream of all those 30,000 people?

If you don't work and have a net worth less than 2 million (so as to live off residuals), you are homeless or starve. Presumably some or many were at Apple because, why not? You gotta work anyway and Apple has good benefits, but many of us know what it is to walk into 10 different interviews and describe your passion for the vision of each of those 10 different companies equally. It's a farce, you just have to pretend to care.

Or, maybe you convince yourself to care, because you know that investing in the company's vision leads to greater success and satisfaction with your work. You have to work anyway, you might as well enjoy it.

Which leads me to two dissatisfactions with our world: First, nobody gets to be bored anymore, and second, our desire to be a part of something greater has been weaponized by capitalist entities.
