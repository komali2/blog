It's a thing, it's got a [subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/onebag), but I
have my own thoughts on the subject, and I've been doing it for about three
years now, so I got tips and tricks as well.

Onebagging is a sort of minimalist tie-in movement of our generation. The basic
idea is when you travel, you take One Bag. No checked bags, no carryon +
personal item, and ABSOLUTELY no rolly luggage.

If you're traveling for vacation with more than one backpack, you're probably
packing way more than you need. One "Onebag** trip is all it will ever take to
hook you permanently. I'll illustrate why.

## Why Onebag
So, why should you give up your rolly case? Why shouldn't you come "prepared
as possible?" The airlines give you two checked bags for FREE on some
international flights, why shouldn't you use them?

### Airtime
You get to the airport, you've got a lot to do. Security and sometimes
immigration on top of it. Why add another step if you don't need it? If you're
checking bags, that's another line you gotta stand in. And in my experience,
it's the longest line, because the airlines have decided that one underpaid
staff is enough to handle rush hour on a 500 person flight.

If you have just one bag and nothing to check, you walk right past the check-in
bullshit and to security. Maybe you hit a kiosk or something to print your
boarding pass, though these days I'm finding I can just use my phone.
Out the cab or off the train with nothing more than a backpack, straight to
security. Lovely.

Next bit is really nice: nowadays airlines have turned overhead space into a
bloodbath they can charge us for the pleasure of participating in. I'm assuming
it's to convince more people to pay for early boarding or something. Get on too
late and they'll make you check your carryon luggage. Not so for a person
traveling with one bag - the true enthusiast doesn't just have one bag, they
have *one bag of personal item size*, i.e., something that will fit under the
seat in front of them. A 25L backpack, say. Not only will it always find a spot
among the rolly suitcases in overhead if you so desire, it will always fit under
the seat in front of you, with the added bonus of all your stuff easily
accessible at all times during the flight. No more fighting your way from the
window seat to open up the overhead because you forgot your water bottle!

Don't forget landing. Stand up, bag in hand, and gtfo the plane. No more
overhead pressing your shit down from the overhead compartment. And, since you
didn't check your luggage, you don't gotta stand by the shiny metal conveyor
belt like all the rest of the assholes, picking out your generic and giant
luggage. Off the plane, straight out the airport or through immigration, and
boom you're done. Like I said, experience it once and you'll never go back.

### Carry Comfort
If you've traveled with me with a couple suitcases, sorry, I'm about to use
you as an example.

Nothing makes me feel more superior than bouncing along my way to the hotel
with friends that are dragging around wheely suitcases, banging them against
light poles and shit while they hunch under thirty pound oversized backpacks,
and I have a lot of things I feel superior about so that's saying something.

Do you *enjoy* having your first experience in a new and wondrous country be
dragging a massive cart around its hard to navigate streets? Is it *fun* missing
out on your first hour or two of experiences because you've got to base the
first half of your first day getting all your bullshit to the hotel? Do you like
stuffing all your crap into the corners of restaurants while pissed off foreign
waiters barely tolerate your presence?

Imagine getting off the plane at 10am and stopping at a cafe real quick before
you head to the hotel. Imagine simply walking with a backpack on to a taxi, or
through the transit system, into the hotel. Imagine being able to do your entire
trip with all the things you brought on your back with very little discomfort.
That's onebagging.
