It's a thing, it's got a [subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/onebag), but I
have my own thoughts on the subject, and I've been doing it for about three
years now, so I got tips and tricks as well.

Onebagging is a sort of minimalist tie-in movement of our generation. The basic
idea is when you travel, you take One Bag. No checked bags, no carryon +
personal item, and ABSOLUTELY no rolly luggage. One bag, usually a decent sized
backpack, something that can fit under the seat in front of you on a plane.

If you're traveling for vacation with more than one backpack, you're probably
packing way more than you need. One "Onebag" trip is all it will ever take to
hook you permanently. I'll illustrate why.

## Why Onebag
So, why should you give up your rolly case? Why shouldn't you come "prepared
as possible?" The airlines give you two checked bags for FREE on some
international flights, why shouldn't you use them?

### Airtime
You get to the airport, you've got a lot to do. Security and sometimes
immigration on top of it. Why add another step if you don't need it? If you're
checking bags, that's another line you gotta stand in. And in my experience,
it's the longest line, because the airlines have decided that one underpaid
staff is enough to handle rush hour on a 500 person flight.

If you have just one bag and nothing to check, you walk right past the check-in
bullshit and straight to security.
Maybe you hit a kiosk or something to print your
boarding pass, though these days I'm finding I can just use my phone.
Out the cab or off the train with nothing more than a backpack, straight to
security. Lovely.

Next bit is really nice: nowadays airlines have turned overhead space into a
bloodsport they can charge us for the pleasure of participating in. I'm assuming
it's to convince more people to pay for early boarding or something. Get on too
late and they'll make you check your carryon luggage. Not so for a person
traveling with one bag - the true enthusiast doesn't just have one bag, they
have *one bag of personal item size*, i.e., something that will fit under the
seat in front of them. A 25L backpack, say. Not only will it always find a spot
among the rolly suitcases in overhead if you so desire, it will always fit under
the seat in front of you, with the added bonus that all of your stuff is easily
accessible at all times during the flight. No more fighting your way from the
window seat to open up the overhead because you forgot your water bottle!

Don't forget landing. Stand up, bag in hand, and gtfo the plane. No more
overhead pressing your shit down from the overhead compartment. And, since you
didn't check your luggage, you don't gotta stand by the shiny metal conveyor
belt like all the rest of the assholes, picking out your generic and giant
luggage. Off the plane, straight out the airport or through immigration, and
boom you're done. Like I said, experience it once and you'll never go back.

### Carry Comfort
If you've traveled with me with a couple suitcases, sorry, I'm about to use
you as an example.

Nothing makes me feel more superior than bouncing along my way to the hotel
with friends that are dragging around wheely suitcases, banging them against
light poles and shit while they hunch under thirty pound oversized backpacks,
and I have a lot of things I feel superior about so that's saying something.

Do you *enjoy* having your first experience in a new and wondrous country be
dragging a massive cart around alien streets? Is it *fun* missing
out on your first three hours in a new country because you've got to spend the
first half of your first day getting all your bullshit to the hotel? Do you like
stuffing all your crap into the corners of restaurants while pissed off foreign
waiters barely tolerate your presence?

Imagine getting off the plane at 10am and stopping at a cafe real quick before
you head to the hotel. Imagine simply walking with a backpack on to a taxi, or
through the transit system, into the hotel. Imagine being able to do your entire
trip with all the things you brought on your back with very little discomfort.
That's onebagging.

### Organization

People bring so much shit traveling and then they can't find what they need.
I remember wasting time in the hotel trying to pick an outfit from all the crap
I bought. Who cares? You're there to experience the destination, that'll be the
same experience no matter what you're wearing! Digging through a wardrobe
on the plane to find my water bottle or whatever. No thanks.

Onebagging keeps you organized. You can only bring what you can fit in one
bag, and really not even, because if you overstuff it, you're going to have a
miserable time getting anything out of it, and you'll have no room to bring back
little snacks. It's a delightful minimalism. The format forces you
to pare down and thus be more organized. You'll start thinking a lot more about
what you bring and why. You'll start thinking more about where stuff goes in
your bag. You'll become more mindful of the functionality of your whole setup.
It'll take a couple trips to get a good system, I for instance am still
developing mine to this day. But, you will be more organized, each and every
trip.

### Zen

Having only one bag on you is zen as fuck. It's freeing. It lets you focus on
the trip rather than all your possessions.
Leave your stuff at home, enjoy the new
place you find yourself in.


## How Onebag

### Principles

Leave room in your bag. There's a tendency to fill space. That's the same
instinct that had you bringing checked bags "just because." Resist this.
I guarantee on your first one bag trip you'll overpack and there's nothing I can
do to prevent you from doing that, but at the very least just remember: Leave
Space. If your bag is full to bursting, you've brought too much. Let go.

Be mindful of every single item. Build a packing list in a notetaking app. Put
EVERYTHING you bring on the app. After the trip, go item to item and ask
yourself how much you used each item, if at all. Then ask yourself whether it
was worth bringing the item. Great candidates to remove from the list are
obviously things that didn't get used once.

Plan on washing clothes while on the trip. See below for details.

Focus on the trip. Why are you traveling to Italy? To smack away on your laptop?
Play angry birds on your ipad? Walk around blasting music on your portable
bluetooth speaker like an asshole?
You gonna try to show up Italian fashion with just
what you can fit in your bag? Focus on the destination, the experience. You
really don't need much at all to enjoy a trip.

Remember you have a credit card. Tim Ferris wrote that if it can be bought at
the destination, don't bring it all, including things like toothbrush,
toothpaste, etc. I think that's overkill, but when you're considering whether
or not to bring a certain item, just remind yourself, if you absolutely need
something during your trip, you can always just pull out the credit card and
buy that item.

### Clothes

The biggest obstacle to reducing down to one bag while traveling is probably
clothing. When we travel we tend to bring an outfit for every conceivable
occasion, not to mention we want to have a different outfit for every day. But
why? You'll never see the people out in about in the foreign country you're in
ever again. Who's gonna know if you wear the same tshirt twice in a week? Or
even two days in a row?

So, first, mindset. You don't need a different outfit every day. You really only
need a few items of clothing, depending on climate. You can get very creative
with layers if you want to look a little different every day. When you choose
clothing, you want each item to

* Wash and dry easily (dry overnight in your hotel room, ideally)
* Work for multiple functions, i.e., walking around all day, a night out, hiking
* Pack small

For all clothing, you'll prevent stinkiness by washing in your sink at night and
hanging to dry overnight or during a day out. I actually find my clothes get
cleaner this way than they do coming out of the washer, so hold your objections
over cleanliness.

Typically, I only pack one kind of pants that looks with with many different
outfits and scenarios, so a khaki-ish colored sturdy pair of chinos. These are
comfortable for all day city walking, work fine on a trail (especially if I roll
the legs up), and will get me into most any club. Unlike jeans, they can wash
and dry in a reasonable amount of time, if needed.

I usually also pack one pair of stylish netless bathing shorts. I can swim in them,
hike in them, go to the gym in them, wear them around on a hot day, and wear
them at night in a hostel as pajamas. They wash and dry extremely quickly, and
roll very small.

Tops you can get very creative with. My typical is one or two light cotton
white t-shirts that can be worn alone, under an open button down, or under a
buttoned-up button down. That, alongside a stylish button-down, are all I need.
I'll wear one in the gym
in the morning and then get back to the hotel, wash it, and wear the other one
while the gym shirt dries. Depending on the country, sometimes I don't really
need the button down to get into clubs and bars.

Jackets are tricky. If you can go without, do. Packability might be less
important if you will literally be wearing it all day every day, but if there's
a chance you will get too hot and need to carry it around in your bag, you'll
be glad you went with a down jacket over a wool one that takes up 50% of your bag
space.

Socks and underwear can get controversial. I usually pack three pairs of
underwear and go through washing cycles. I get really quick cleaning and drying
Airism boxers from Uniqlo. To some people, the thought of washing their undies
in the sink is disgusting. To those people I say, wash your ass in the shower
better. As for socks, I bring one or at most two pairs. Darn Tough is an oft
recommended brand, though I find they don't breath and make my feet too sweaty,
so I just wear Uniqlo heattech.

Shoes: Never bring. Only wear. At MOST pack a pair of flip flops or sandals.

### Bag

Of course, if you're going to carry only one bag with you all over the world, it
should be a good one. There's lots of recommendation articles out there, I say
for starters head over to the onebag subreddit for a couple suggestions. Brands
I particularly like are:

* [Tom Binh](https://www.tombihn.com/) My bag of choice is a Tom Binh, and I'll
be putting a review up at some point.
* [Timbuk2](https://www.timbuk2.com/) An oft recommended similarly premium brand
to Tom Binh. I've yet to own one but from what I've handled at the store, it's
a good choice.
* [Patagonia](https://www.patagonia.com/home/) Harsh weather focused premium
brand.
* [Osprey](https://www.osprey.com/us/en/) A good budget brand, bags easily
gotten on Amazon.

Size: You want the 25-35 liter range. Note that this isn't an official
measurement by any means, but generally speaking bags labeled with this size
will be about the same size. A lot of people argue for bags will full-open
zippers so you can pack them lain flat, but in my opinion that's unnecessary.

### Gear

Laptop AND a tablet. Big chunky water bottle. Heavy books. Gear doesn't
typically take up as much space as clothes, but there's lots of ways to save
space and weight here.

When it comes to electronics, ask yourself what you REALLY need to enjoy your
trip. Often on vacation I've realized there's simply no need at all for a
laptop. I regret bringing one at all to Vietnam. Everything I needed to do I
did on my phone, even if I had to get creative, like by popping my micro SD
card out of the SD converter that was in my DSLR, putting it in my phone,
uploading my photos, clearing space, and popping it back in. Phones can do a
hell of a lot nowadays. Get a
[USB-C to HDMI converter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PWK6Q4V) and
you can plug your phone into the TV as a little entertainment center. Or, bring
along a Roku stick or Chromecast for casting.

Stop carrying water bottles, start carrying
[water bags.](https://smile.amazon.com/Platypus-DuoLock-SoftBottle-Collapsible-1-0-Liter/dp/B01N0O7SDE)
They weigh far less and only take up as much space as they have water in them.

Don't bring paper books. Get a kindle. They're like 80 bucks now, or grab one
off ebay for even cheaper.
Let go of the Smells or whatever reason you're stilling
dragging around books that weigh kilos when you could just carry ten thousand
books in a device that weighs 300 grams.

Later, I'll publish a full packing list.
