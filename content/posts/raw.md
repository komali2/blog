My friend Tiffany miraculously got us a reservation at [Raw](https://www.raw.com.tw/en), a two Michelin star restaurant from Chef André Chiang. We've spent a year and a half trying to get a reservation there, turns out the trick is to book an 8 person table. Luckily for us, that table was the kitchen table, right next to where food was coming out with clear view in on what the kitchen was up to. Literally a dream.

The reservation process was intense: we had to pay for basically the entire bill, coming in around 250$ USD per person, beforehand. We also get stern warnings about arriving exactly on time, which is pretty normal for fancy tasting menus. I'm guessing it has to do with sometimes having two services per evening, or in our case just because the whole meal takes literally the entire night.

True to their timeliness warning, they didn't open the doors until the exact minute of our reservation, leaving us standing around in the rain for a bit, which was a bummer because the first thing you see when you walk in is the most fantastic bar I've ever encountered:

They had a couple of these wood structures, all humongous, all smelling like tea trees. One wrapped around the two group tables and sort of separated us from the rest of the restaurant:

We sat at an enormous slab of wood and were given pretty little menus, as well as a French flag pin thing that we were required to put on our clothes somewhere visible. When asked, we were told it's "the dress code." Never got much more explanation than that, though the impression is that Raw's style switches around, so if we were really lucky and had come in a Taiwan based season, we might have gotten Taiwan flag pins. 

We also got menus for a wine pairing, as well as something I've never heard of before: a bread pairing. At 400NTD extra we started to get a little worried: was this two michelin star restaurant with a celebrity chef *nickle and diming us?* Charging extra for bread on top of a 250 USD dinner? 250 USD in Taiwan, mind, where a good lunch can be had for 3 USD. When I visited Pierre Gagnairre, a 3 michelin star restaurant in Paris and by some counts one of the best restaurants in the world, dinner went for about 300$ USD per person, without wine. So, before the food came, we spent a lot of time speculating on wtf was going on with the prices here.

Turns out to have been totally worth it, whole kit. Later Tammy read more into the restaurant and chef, including finding an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsaXr2h478k) he did with Taiwan's Digital Minister, Audrey Tang. Prices may be so high at least partially because the staff are getting paid huge wages for Taiwan, in which case, I'm all for it. The kind of people eating at the restaurant are all probably already making high-for-USA salaries, so might as well charge USA rates and bump the local workforce a bit. 

So, Tammy and I go doubles on the bread pairing (waiter recommendation due to size of the pairing) as well as wine pairing (because wine pairings are usually WAY too much alcohol for us lightweights). We had a wee drama with a late member of our table, and then the waiter launched into an introduction of the restaurant, all in English luckily. What we gleaned was that we were nearing the end of the Autumn seasonal menu, which was focusing on historic French dishes, including one from what is apparently the oldest cookbook in the world.

The first dish was just the starting bread, with the first wine. Those without a bread pairing got nothing, lol, get dunked on you bread fearing fools.

{{< figure src="/images/uploads/20221006_183722.jpg" alt="The butter that came with the first bread pairing" caption="The butter and nutty crumble included with all the bread pairings." >}}

The first wine was "Grain de Folie," 2020 by Domaine Mmaruta. A sparkling rosé that I described in my notes as "smelling dry, super dry taste, and not strong flavor." I don't know shit about wine though.

The bread was croissant vibes, chewy / crunchy mix. Butter was great, had a cream cheese smell but was really whipped and soft. I wrote "strong goat butter taste" in my notes, but I have no idea what that means, and at one drink in I can't blame being drunk yet, so, who knows. Came with a nutty cocoa-powdery sesame seedish mix that added a lot of savory to the salty butter.

Right on the tails of first wine came the first dish.

{{< figure src="/images/uploads/20221006_184422.jpg" alt="The first dish, with the spherical glass orb opened." caption="undefined" >}}

The first dish was titled "Aspic de Macedoine de legumes aux Ecrevisses," on the top left in the picture above, and is a cognac consomme with a crayfish inside. "Rillettes de Sardines fumees aux fleurs de thym" is the Sardine cracker in the white sphere dish, and "Cuisse de Nymphe et Escargot en Persillade," the two cakepop lookin things on the bottom. One is snail, the other, frog leg. We were told that the sardine cracker is apparently monk food from back when monks were hanging out, and that the dishes were based on / inspired by some 13th century first recipe book. 

The consome crayfish orb was super olive oily, and smelled like cilantro. The orb itself kinda tasted like meat fat, super jelly-like. The whole thing had a really nutty tomato vibe, very wholesome autumnal flavor. The crayfish just tasted like a really good shrimp lol.

The sardine cracker had a rich salmon smell. It was really light and crunchy and came in with a deep I guess umami flavor? I never know if something is umami or not. Towards the end of it was a sort of tiny fish bone texture that I always hated, but it was still good.

The frog cakepop thing, on the left, smelled like Hainan chicken oil, and tasted basically like chicken, with a strong veggie base. The green sauce under the cakepops was really good, everyone at our table loved it. The snail, the green ball on the right, had a fun outer texture, like cheese almost.

Jesse demanded I write down the ingredients of the green sauce, which we were told are "extra virgin olive oil, garlic, parsley, and dijon mustard."

{{< figure src="/images/uploads/img_4789.jpg" alt="Glass of the second wine" caption="French, very flowery smell, but also almost menthol / medicine smell. Not very strong flavor." >}}

After the cakepop monk food plate came the second wine and a ridiculously perfect pâté. Undecorated plate except for a bit of salt/pepper I didn't bother with. I thought the addition of pickles was a bit weird but whatever. 

{{< figure src="/images/uploads/20221006_190309.jpg" alt="Pastry edge of the Pâté" caption="The pastry of the Pâté was perfectly crunchy" >}}

{{< figure src="/images/uploads/20221006_190320.jpg" alt="Jelly edge of the Pâté" caption="The jelly was so salty and good! " >}}

{{< figure src="/images/uploads/20221006_190433.jpg" alt="Side view of the loaf of Pâté" caption="They brought out an uncut loaf of the Pâté for us to ooh and aah over. Desperately wanted to just take a bite out of it like it was a baguette. " >}}

{{< figure src="/images/uploads/pxl_20221006_110444030.jpg" alt="Top down view of the loaf of Pâté" caption="We were told that the large circles are where tubes were inserted to allow for more even cooking of the Pâté, and then later filled with jelly. " >}}

The pâté was pork, deer, duck, and chicken liver. Smelled like hella meaty pâté, but also light and fruity. Taste was light as well, not that kinda heavy oily taste you get sometimes from pâtés. It was a bit chewy, occasionally getting hit with onion or pickle, and some tang. The side was of course perfectly crunchy and incredible. The menu calls the dish "Pâté en croute du Chaseur," with "cepes mushroom, game, deer, partridge, wild board, and cornichon," and it was apparently worked on with Frederic Jullien, sous-chef at l'atelier de Joel Robuchon in Taipei. Obviously Andre Chiang is buddies with the entire food scene in Taiwan. 

When we got to chat with Chef Chiang, he said he felt somewhat dismayed that many of his dishes, including the pâté, are difficult if not impossible to find anymore in the world, done in the fashion that he does them. More on that to follow, but he was proud to point out the tube technique as well as the perfect right angles of the pastry exterior, indicative of a sort of combination traditionalist and perfectionist attitude for the menu.

{{< figure src="/images/uploads/20221006_191945.jpg" alt="The second bread" caption="The second bread was all THYME, right in the face" >}}

We were all excited for the next dish, genuine ratatouille, well, "Ratatouille Revisitée" in this case. When it came out, yup, looks just like from the movie lol:

{{< figure src="/images/uploads/20221006_192442.jpg" alt="Top down shot of the ratatouille" caption="undefined" >}}

{{< figure src="/images/uploads/20221006_192438.jpg" alt="Macro shot of the ratatouille" caption="undefined" >}}

With "aubergine, zucchini, bay leaf, capsicums, and basil," it smelled strongly of roasted vegetable. The included soup smelled of tomatoes and onions, almost like a very tomato-y french onion soup, with a hint of nut. The soup is apparently roasting juices from the ratatouille with chicken broth. The paste is of zuchinni. The eggplant came out strong int he dish, as did the basil. The texture was mostly soft with some crunch, I felt maybe from the zuchinni mostly. 

Next up was caviar and monkfish.

{{< figure src="/images/uploads/20221006_194743.jpg" alt="The caviar and monkfish" caption="undefined" >}}

The menu calls the dish "Medaillon de Baudrioe a la mousseline au Champagne," with "PERSEUS Superior Oscietra a la royale, monkfish, and leek compote." As soon as it was brought out, there was a strong smell of fish, which kind of worried us for a second, but the taste itself was not very strongly fishy, more buttery. The sauce we were told is egg, baked butter, and champagne. It was all very herby with a good, not too soft texture. There were hints of fruit in the fish, even without the champagne sauce.

The third wine was brought out after the monkfish was finished.

{{< figure src="/images/uploads/img_4800.jpg" alt="The third wine, in a glass" caption="I wrote down that it was "flat and creamy," I can't imagine what I meant by "flat," but I don't remember any negative feelings about it, so perhaps just a non dynamic flavor? " >}}
