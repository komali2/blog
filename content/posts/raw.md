My friend Tiffany miraculously got us a reservation at [Raw](https://www.raw.com.tw/en), a two Michelin star restaurant from Chef Andr√© Chiang. We've spent a year and a half trying to get a reservation there, turns out the trick is to book an 8 person table. Luckily for us, that table was the kitchen table, right next to where food was coming out with clear view in on what the kitchen was up to. Literally a dream.
